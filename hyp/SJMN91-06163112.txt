Mount Pinatubo, the Philippine volcano that erupted Saturday after six centuries of quiet, is likely to explode in the next few days or weeks with force comparable to the Mount St. Helens explosion, a U.S. government scientist said Monday.
"I think we could see a major explosive eruption any time," said Peter Lipman, a volcanologist at the U.S. Geological Survey office in Menlo Park.
Lipman is in daily contact with five USGS scientists in the Philippines who have been studying the volcano since April, when it first stirred.
A huge cloud of ash-laden steam rose up to 11,500 feet above the volcano today, spreading ash over a six-mile radius, the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology said.
If it does erupt, the deadly hot ash produced by the volcano could sweep across adjoining Clark Air Base, he said.
Even if the volcano does not erupt, the threat of eruption is likely to keep the base closed for weeks at least, Lipman said.
Scientists doubt it's more than coincidence that the eruption is occurring at the same time as the Mount Unzen volcano in Japan, he said.
The five USGS scientists are among the few remaining people at Clark Air Base, which was evacuated along with thousands of Filipinos living near the volcano.
Other recent volcanoes that erupted on the same scale were El Chichon in Mexico in 1983 and Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia in 1985.
