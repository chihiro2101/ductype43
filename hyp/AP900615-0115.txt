Thunderstorms swept through central and eastern Ohio, causing flooding that killed at least ten people, left dozens missing and forced hundreds of others from their homes, officials said today.
Two creeks just outside this Ohio River village of 4,300 people overflowed when about 4 inches of rain fell Thursday night in about an hour.
``It created a wall of water,'' said Jim Williams of the Ohio Emergency Management Agency.
``The problem we're having right now is accounting for the people we can't find.''
The raging waters knocked homes off their foundations and washed away a bar filled with people in Shadyside, an Appalachian Mountain foothill town.
Four bodies were brought to the hospital from the Shadyside area, hospital spokesman Lawrence England said.
The Shadyside Fire Department set up a command center at the Jefferson Elementary School to coordinate rescue efforts.
Command center spokeswoman Karen Bovek said officials had no complete death toll figure.
Authorities were searching for victims in rural areas.
Shadyside Fire Chief Mark Badia said rescuers pulled people from three cars in Wegee Creek, which flows through Shadyside and into the Ohio River.
There also was flooding in Jefferson County, north of Belmont, and Licking County in central Ohio.
Residents from Newark and Marne in Licking County spent Thursday night in three emergency shelters, said Licking County Disaster Services Agency spokesman Neil Snelling.
