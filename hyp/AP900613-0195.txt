Ethnic violence killed 148 people and wounded 885 this month in the Central Asian republic of Kirghizia, the official news agency Tass said Wednesday.
Tass said 748 of the injured had to be hospitalized and said a search was continuing for a police officer who vanished June 7.
No new outbreaks were reported in the region near the border city of Osh in western Kirghizia, where clashes arising from a land dispute began on June 2 between ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks, both Sunni Moslems.
The general was quoted as saying these conflicts ``were often accompanied by riots and pogroms, arson and massacre of innocent people, (and) complete or partial destabilization of the situation.''
