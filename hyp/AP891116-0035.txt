A tornado slammed into a shopping district, a residential area and a school Wednesday, killing at least 15 people, injuring more than 300 and trapping people in cars and homes, authorities said.
Cars are piled on top of each other under piles of rubble where buildings used to be,'' said Danny Cooper, state emergency management director in Montgomery.
Emergency officials in Huntsville reported 15 confirmed deaths, said Henry Jurnigan, a duty officer with the state Emergency Management Agency in Montgomery.
Rescue teams with cranes and floodlights searched the rubble through the night for injured or dead.
Rescuers picked through piles of rubble 10 to 14 feet deep, and Cooper said police were unable to determine the extent of the damaged area.
Witnesses said the downtown Jones Valley Elementary School, the Waterford Square and adjacent Queensbury apartment complexes were reduced to rubble by the tornado.
The city is home to Marshall Space Flight Center and the Army's Redstone Arsenal, but no serious damage was reported from the space agency or weapons testing center.
``We've called in troopers from around the state to help,'' Kelly said.
Telephone communication and electricity were disrupted by the tornadoes and WAAY-TV, the only station still broadcasting, reported widespread damage.
The National Weather Service earlier said a tornado hit the east Alabama hamlet of Mellow Valley, severely damaging at least one home and causing some injuries.
A spokeswoman for the Clay County Sheriff's Department said people were injured at one house in a rural area 30 miles east of Sylacauga.
