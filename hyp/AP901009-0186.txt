John Lennon's worldwide message of peace was delivered Tuesday as his song ``Imagine'' was played simultaneously for 1 billion people in 130 countries to celebrate what would have been his 50th birthday.
``A dream we dream alone is only a dream, but the dream we dream together is reality.
The world is better today for sharing a time with you,''
Yoko Ono said at a United Nations ceremony before the playing of ``Imagine.''
The slain former Beatle himself issued a call for harmony in a taped message that served as an introduction to the music.
None of the other Beatles were at the United Nations, but a tribute came from Lennon's old songwriting partner, Paul McCartney, who released a live version of the Beatles' tune ``Birthday.''
The song, originally on the ``White Album,'' was the first Lennon-McCartney single released since the Beatles broke up in 1969.
``The release date and John's birthday is just a happy coincidence, but it's also a nod and a wink to my old mate,'' said McCartney, 47.
In Lennon's hometown in England, fans gathered at the former site of the Cavern Club, where the Beatles were discovered.
Ono was greeted by Marcela Perez de Cuellar, wife of the U.N. secretary-general.
In Moscow, about 1,000 Soviets gathered at the Moscow Electrical Lamp Factory's cultural hall to listen to Lennon's music, snap up his albums and posters and reflect on his life.
