Aspirin sales jumped 41 percent for a few weeks earlier this year, not because of a rash of headaches.
A study of more than 22,000 male doctors had shown that taking a single aspirin every other day could cut heart attack risk in half.
The study was one of a series of recent reports showing for the first time that doctors are able not only to treat heart attacks _ but also to prevent them.
Without the treatment, patients had a 13 percent chance of dying from a second heart attack within five weeks, the researchers found.
``The real discovery is that treatment for patients is going to reduce in-hospital mortality substantially,'' says Richard Peto of Oxford University, one of the study's authors.
The National Center for Health Statistics reports that 762,820 Americans died of heart disease in 1987.
The usual cause of heart attacks is a blockage of the coronary arteries, which supply the heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood.
``We have to know how to respond quickly, and we have to have the courage to use these drugs in the absence of definitive diagnosis,'' says Dr. Burton Sobel of Washington University in St. Louis, a pioneer in the testing of the clot-dissolvers.
The patients given early discharge were able to return to work two weeks sooner than others in the study group.
U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop in July issued his first report on nutrition, calling on Americans to lower their consumption of fats and to eat more vegetables, fruits, fish, poultry and whole grains.
The report has been likened to the first Surgeon Generals report on smoking, issued in 1964, which focused public attention on smoking's hazards.
