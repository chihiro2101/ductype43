Thousands of miners in the northern Vorkuta region are expanding their strike and some are blocking coal shipments, the Soviet news media reported Friday.
The miners are demanding the government fulfill promises of improved living and job conditions.
Soviet officials have said the strikes could force fuel rationing during the Soviet Union's severe winter.
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov introduced a bill in parliament that would increase pension benefits by about 40 percent and upgrade benefits for coal miners, the official Tass news agency reported.
