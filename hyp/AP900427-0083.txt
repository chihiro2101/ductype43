The lens cover on the Hubble Space Telescope opened today after a morning of worrisome problems, and Mission Control told the Discovery astronauts they no longer are needed to rescue the $1.5 billion instrument.
``You've been released from Hubble support; it's on its own,'' Mission Control told the astronauts when the aluminum aperture door opened.
``There are handshakes and smiles all around up here,'' said Steve Hawley, who had been at the controls when the telescope was released into its own orbit on Wednesday.
The successful opening of the lens cover paved the way for the astronauts to return to Earth on Sunday.
They had blasted into space Tuesday after a two-week delay and dispatched the telescope from its payload bay Wednesday.
``The Hubble is open for business,'' Mission Control told the astronauts.
The telescope still was having problems, however.
The team at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, which guides the telescope, said the door-opening motion jarred the telescope more than had been expected and that the system reacted properly in shutting down.
Steve Terry, a top Hubble engineering official, said tolerances for the telescope systems had been set particularly narrow for the first operations and that was the cause of many malfunctions.
The space shuttle Discovery, which carried the telescope to orbit, was 50 miles behind the telescope, ready to lend a hand if needed.
The lens cover, a 10-foot diameter ``aperature door,'' covers the opening to the telescope's light shield.
Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan would have performed a space walk to open the door Saturday if necessary.
It is capable of detecting objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the best ground-based observatory.
