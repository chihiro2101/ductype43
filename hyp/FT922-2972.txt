ABOUT 20 banks became con-cerned last summer at the behaviour of businesses run by Robert Maxwell several months before he died and his business empire collapsed.
Their concern arose when Maxwell Communication Corporation made late payments to them, a Financial Times investigation has discovered.
Starting about July 4 1991, MCC's treasury, under the authority of Maxwell and his son, Kevin, had begun to buy and sell enormous amounts of foreign currencies.
Mr Brookes says about 20 banks, including Lloyds, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Swiss Bank Corporation, were involved in the flurry of foreign exchange deals.
At a meeting between Maxwell and Mr John Melbourn, a NatWest director, on July 10, NatWest refused Maxwell's request for a loan of Pounds 45m.
