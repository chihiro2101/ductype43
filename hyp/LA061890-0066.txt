The death toll from flash floods that swept through a rural area of eastern Ohio increased to 19 Sunday as searchers dug along two creeks and dived into the Ohio River.
Workers used shovels and picks to dig along the creek banks, and sifted through debris at places marked with red flags, where search dogs indicated they had detected human scents, National Guard Capt.
One body was found Sunday in debris along Wegee Creek, about three miles from where it meets the river, said Belmont County coroner's investigator Chuck Vogt.
The body of a man was found Sunday afternoon in the Ohio River, a half-mile south of the mouth of Wegee Creek and about seven miles south of Shadyside, Vogt said.
That brought the confirmed death toll in Thursday's floods to 19, including five children.
The digging will continue at least through Tuesday, Fire Chief Mark Badia said.
"The thing you find once you start into these brush piles and piles of trees are cars, and they have to be torn apart and searched separately," Badia said.
Vogt said he doubted many of the missing would be found alive.
Eighteen Ohio counties have been declared federal disaster areas since tornadoes and flooding first struck May 25.
