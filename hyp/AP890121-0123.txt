Grieving relatives and friends gathered at memorial services Saturday to mourn the five school children slain by a camouflage-garbed, suicidal drifter.
``Although there are some people in the United States who do bad things, most of the people in the United States do good things,'' said Patricia Busher, principal of Cleveland Elementary School, where the killings and the woundings of 29 students and one teacher happened last Tuesday.
``Tragedy has followed you,'' state Sen. John Garamendi told the families, refugees from a country where more than 1 million people were killed in executions and enforced hardship after a 1975 communist takeover.
The service, held in Central Methodist Church, was for 8-year-old Oeun Lim, 9-year-old Rathanan Or, 8-year-old Ram Chun and 6-year-old Sokhim An.
Patrick Edward Purdy, who turned a gun on himself after firing more than 100 rounds from an AK-47 semi-automatic assault rifle at Cleveland Elementary, where he had attended grade school, was buried Friday in an unmarked grave in a family plot at Lodi.
