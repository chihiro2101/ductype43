["Highlights" column by Fahd al-Fanik: "The New U.S. Ambassador"]
The new U.S. ambassador to Jordan, Wesley Egan, is a heavyweight.
Once the second man in the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, he also served in Saudi Arabia, two African countries, and a European nation.
In his testimony, Egan told the hearing he would work to develop relations between the United States and Jordan and enhance Jordan's role in the peace process.
These territories, contended the senator, were never the sovereign domain of anyone; it was Jordan that occupied the West Bank at the founding of the state of Israel.
