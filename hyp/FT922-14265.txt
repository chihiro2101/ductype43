SAM WALTON was arguably the most important retailer of his generation.
The son of an Oklahoma real-estate broker, he opened the first general store in what was to become the Wal-Mart chain in Bentonville, in the backwaters of Arkansas, in 1950, writes Martin Dickson.
By 1991 the chain's sales had risen to nearly Dollars 44bn, making it the world's largest retailer in terms of revenues, and the Walton family probably America's richest.
The chain's success stemmed both from Mr Walton's personality and willingness to challenge accepted retailing orthodoxy.
