The women's field for Sunday's San Francisco Marathon appears mighty impressive to race President Rich Nichols, who didn't have to do much coaxing to get the highly ranked women to enter.
"This year's women's field is interesting because most of the competitors called us," said Nichols.
The Olympic trials, scheduled for January, have made Nichols' job much easier this year.
Most top-ranked U.S. women are looking for any summer-time marathon in which to run and the San Francisco version offers excellent conditions.
Last year's winner, Janis Klecker of Minnetonka, Minn., is entered.
Julie Shea-Graw of Raleigh, N.C., and Jane Welzel of Fort Collins, Colo.
Welzel is the 1990 national champion, Gibbons has won 26 marathons, Lahane is a former cross-country national champion and Aiello twice has finished second in San Francisco.
Shea-Graw, 32, finished third in the 1981 New York City Marathon and was consistently ranked among the top five American runners throughout most of the early '80s.
