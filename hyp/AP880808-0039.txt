Overcrowding and safety violations caused an aging ferry to capsize in the Ganges River, killing as many as 400 people, a government report said.
The ferry accident was said to be India's worst ever.
Authorities believe about 100 people swam to safety or were rescued by villagers.
The situation was made more dangerous by wheat bags loaded on the ferry.
The steam-powered vessel started wavering soon after it left the banks and capsized about 100 yards from the shore.
We can't see anything, so we just have to feel by our hands.''
Katihar District Police Chief P.S. Natarajah said chances of finding any survivors were ``very, very dim.''
One survivor, Chadrasekhar D. Tiwary, said he was standing on the ferry's upper deck when it started wavering.
Ram Prasad Yadaw's wife and four other family members vanished in the accident.
It was the worst boat accident ever in India, according to the United News of India.
At least 150 people died on July 5, 1970, when a boat capsized in Krishna River in eastern India.
Mangan Chand, a police officer, said only one body surfaced near the ferry Sunday.
He said he was waiting for the bodies so he could cremate them according to Hindu rites.
The boat trip is normally used by Hindu pilgrims going across the river to worship at a shrine of Lord Shiva in Deoghar town.
