The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for a huge explosion Friday that reduced a three-story military barracks on the southeast coast of England to rubble, killing 10 people and injuring 22, eight seriously.
It would be one of the outlawed IRA's deadliest attacks on the main British island.
Nine marine musicians and one civilian died in the blast, which also damaged dozens of nearby homes and could be heard two miles away.
A police spokesman said forensic experts are still trying to determine with certainty that the explosion was the result of a bomb.
But he said the characteristics of the blast and a statement claiming responsibility appeared to confirm that it was the work of the IRA.
One member, known as the "Jackal" after the assassin in the Frederick Forsyth novel "The Day of the Jackal," has been eluding the authorities for two years.
Friday's explosion occurred about 8:30 a.m. in a lounge at the Royal Marines School of Music near Deal, on the English Channel in the county of Kent.
At the school are about 250 recruits who receive military and musical training before joining Royal Marines bands.
"I looked up from the sink and I just saw the whole building explode," Heather Hackett, a 26-year-old Deal housewife, told the British Press Assn.
Her 2-year-old son, Joshua, was hit by a shard that embedded itself in his back but caused no serious injury.
Defense Secretary Tom King visited the scene and called the bombing "an appalling outrage committed against unarmed bandsmen -- people who worked for charity, who have given great enjoyment to millions right across the country, right across the world.
