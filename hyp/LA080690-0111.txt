Iraq struck back against the West today, rounding up hundreds of foreign nationals in Kuwait, as the U.N. Security Council overwhelming approved sweeping trade and military sanctions against Iraq to punish it for invading the emirate.
The Iraqi invaders scoured hotels looking for some of the thousands of Westerners based in Kuwait or caught by the invasion.
Several hundred Britons, Americans and West Germans were grabbed in the hotels, and some were taken to Iraq, the West German and British foreign ministries said.
Britain said Baghdad had given no reason for detaining 366 people, most of them passengers from a British Airways flight stranded at Kuwait airport by the invasion.
Iraqi troops rolled into its New Jersey-sized neighbor Thursday, conquering the capital and moving south toward the Saudi Arabian border.
Persian Gulf oil sources said today that they had seen Saudi troops moving north toward the Kuwaiti frontier near the oil port of Khafji, but the Saudis denied that they had sent reinforcements to the border.
