Nothing so important has happened in Soviet politics since 1917, when the Bolsheviks seized power.
In Moscow on Wednesday, the system the Bolsheviks and Joseph Stalin created finally collapsed.
A new historical epoch began.
Soviets had an experience comparable to those that transformed the outlooks of Poles, Hungarians, Czechs and Slovaks in 1989, when they learned they could finally be free.
Soviets' courage in resisting this putsch announced the arrival of a nation capable of self-governance.
For the first time in their thousand-year history, Russians asserted their independence from autocracy, and the autocrats fell.
There will be much to sort out in the months ahead.
That revolution will alter the country, creating a new, decentralized and probably smaller Soviet Union much more quickly than anyone anticipated.
Gorbachev was the most resourceful and creative political leader of the late 20th century, but this week he was trumped by Boris Yeltsin, who will now rightly be seen as the man who saved him.
For years, Soviets and Western Kremlinologists had debated whether the changes that created this new Soviet Union were irreversible.
By Tuesday night, the Emergency Committee was in a confrontation with the political legitimacy of Yeltsin, and this proved an unequal contest.
