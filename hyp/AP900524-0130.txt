Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Thursday accused India of waging ``genocide'' in secession-minded Kashmir and of trying to start a war with Pakistan to deflect attention.
Her remarks raised tensions further between India and Pakistan, which have been feuding over Indian-controlled Kashmir.
``India is indulging in genocide,'' Ms. Bhutto said at a news conference Thursday after returning from a weeklong tour of eight Moslem countries in the Middle East and North Africa.
Ms. Bhutto returned late Wednesday from visits to Iran, Turkey, Syria, Jordan, North Yemen, Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, a high-profile diplomatic offensive to drum up support for Pakistan's stand on the Kashmir issue.
Hindu-dominated India accuses Pakistan of arming and training Kashmiri militants fighting for secession of Jammu-Kashmir, India's only state with a Moslem majority.
However, she added, ``If subjected to aggression, we would have the full support of the Arab Islamic nations.
