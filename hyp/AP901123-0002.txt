For almost a decade, Margaret Thatcher was regarded at the White House as America's best friend, the trusted ally whose strong views reinforced the conservative tone of administration policies.
Among Western allies, she was alone at Ronald Reagan's side in 1986 in supporting the U.S. bombing of Libya.
In the Persian Gulf crisis, she boldly joined with George Bush in sending troops to the Middle East.
``You always know where she was and what she believed,'' Bush said upon hearing of her decision to resign.

They shared rocky relations with organized labor.
Reagan successfully fired the nation's air traffic controllers, dealing a devastating blow to labor.
They were ideological soulmates and called each other Ronnie and Margaret.
Mrs. Thatcher encouraged the huge Pentagon buildup that Reagan nurtured under the theme of peace through strength.
She was a big backer of U.S. efforts to install medium-range missiles in Europe and always seemed cautious - perhaps reluctant - when it came to disarmament.
When Argentina and Britain clashed militarily over the Falkland Islands, the United States was forced to make a painful choice between two allies.
No one suspects that Britain's new leadership - whoever it is - will take a soft line toward Iraq.
