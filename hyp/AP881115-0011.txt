Leonard Bernstein, whose 70th birthday in August was marked with a gala at Tanglewood, returned to Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic 45 years after he made his triumphant conducting debut there with the orchestra.
And of course, Monday night's program consisted of three Bernstein compositions that were played shimmeringly well.
On Nov. 14, 1943, Bernstein, the Philharmonic's then-assistant conductor, filled for an ailing Bruno Walter on such short notice there was no rehearsal.
Eight others who also were members in 1943 _ violinist Louis Fishzohn, oboist Albert Goltzer, timpanist Saul Goodman, bassist Homer Mensch, cellist Martin Ormandy, assistant concertmaster Michael Rosenker, and trumpeters James Smith and William Vacchiano
Violinist Gidon Kremer, a native of the Latvian town of Riga in the Soviet Union, was soloist in ``Serenade for Violin, String Orchestra, Harp and Percussion.''
He was the respectful and thoroughly engaged soloist in the final work on the program, Bernstein's ``Symphony No. 2 for Piano and Orchestra,'' subtitled ``The Age of Anxiety'' after W.H. Auden's poem.
