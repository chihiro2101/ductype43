Moslem militants armed with automatic rifles shot and killed two unarmed paramilitary soldiers on Thursday in Srinagar, the flashpoint of a violent separatist campaign, officials said.
Witnesses said a cigarette vendor also was killed in the attack, which occurred outside the vendor's kiosk in the Chanpora suburb of the city.
A bystander was injured, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The deaths brought to 81 the number of people killed since Jan. 20 in clashes between security forces and Moslem militants fighting for secession of the Moslem-dominated Kashmir region from Hindu-majority India.
Most victims have been protesters shot while defying a curfew imposed Jan. 20 when government forces launched a crackdown.
A senior police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said militants exploded bombs in a government building and a government-run bank in Srinagar's outskirts Thursday, causing severe damage.
The two paramilitary Border Security Force officers were shot with Chinese-designed AK-47 rifles from close range as they walked from their camp toward the cigarette kiosk, 100 yards from the camp's gate, said Ashok Patel, inspector-general of the Border Security Force.
