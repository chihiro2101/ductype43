The damaged battleship USS Iowa steamed home from Puerto Rico on Friday while investigators on board interviewed crewmen and reviewed an amateur videotape of the explosion that killed 47 sailors.
Karl Johnson, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman, said the Navy would not release the exact position of the ship, which was expected to reach its home port here about 5:30 p.m. Sunday.
The Washington Post reported in its Saturday editions that crewmen in the upper chambers of the gun turret were killed by the explosion and fire while sailors working several levels below suffocated when the blast sucked all the oxygen out of the spaces.
After the fire was extinguished, crew men worked quickly to remove the shells and powder from the other two guns before they could explode, the newspaper said.
The Navy released photographs of the firefighting effort, which authorities said required two hours to put out the blaze and cool off the turret before anyone could enter it.
The Pentagon said the blast ripped through the middle gun of the three-gun turret, and that that gun had not been fired prior to the explosion.
