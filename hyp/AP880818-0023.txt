Dan Quayle has not yet been nominated for vice president and already Republicans are comparing him to Thomas Jefferson and John F. Kennedy.
Sen. John Warner of Virginia, who served with Quayle on a Senate subcommittee, told an audience that whenever he heard the Indiana senator speak, ``I'd say, `there stands the next Thomas Jefferson.'''
And, added Warner, ``he does have the same fire in his belly as our great forefather Thomas Jefferson of Virginia.''
Former president Gerald Ford made the comparison with Kennedy, a Democrat.
``In 1960, the American people voted for John F. Kennedy for president and he was the relatively same age as Dan Quayle,'' said Ford.
``John Kennedy had been in the House and Senate 14 years before he was elected president and Dan Quayle's had 12 years.''
``He's attractive because of his looks, he's attractive because of his enthusiasm,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
