Actresses Lauren Bacall, Betty Comden and Phyllis Newman are among performers in the birthday bash being thrown in August for conductor Leonard Bernstein at the music center where he got his start.
The Tanglewood Music Center also is celebrating the 50th anniversary of its Music
The Bernstein weekend alone, with tickets as high as $5,000 each, may bring in more than $1 million for the festival's endowment fund, according to Caroline Smedvig of the symphony.
``Because Tanglewood is so special for him and, conversely, he's so special to us, the combination will produce what we hope will be a unique event,'' she said.
The Leonard Bernstein Gala Birthday Performance is a four-day affair beginning on the composer's 70th birthday, Aug. 25, to raise money for the music center.
Beverly Sills, who announced last month that she will step down as general director of the New York City Opera, will be the host of the event.
Bacall and soprano Barbara Hendricks will perform a movement from Bernstein's Symphony No. 3, ``Kaddish.''
The orchestra opened the nine-week season with the special July 1 concert marking the first half-century of the Music Shed.
