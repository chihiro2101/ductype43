MR MICHAEL STONEY, a senior executive in a number of Maxwell companies, is named as one of three people primarily responsible for more than Pounds 180m of 'unusual' payments from Mirror Group Newspapers bank accounts during the last financial year, according to the chairman's statement released with MGN accounts yesterday.
Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell, two sons of the late Robert Maxwell, are named as the other two people most involved in these transactions.
Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Stoney refused to provide MGN with information, the statement says.
Sir Robert Clark, chairman of MGN, lists a series of transactions - some of which he stresses may have been perfectly legitimate - that took place in the past few months.
Sir Robert says that during the year there were at least 28 'unusual' payments for more than Pounds 1m from the group's bank accounts, making a total of more than Pounds 180m. '
Sir Robert says the MGN directors do not believe that either Mr Burrington or Mr Guest knew there was anything improper about these payments.
