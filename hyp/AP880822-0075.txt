Rescuers searched through debris today for victims of an earthquake that ravaged one-third of this country's territory and parts of India, killing at least 650 people and injuring thousands.
The death toll was expected to climb from Sunday's pre-dawn quake on the India-Nepal border, which triggered landslides and floods and was the mountainous region's deadliest in 38 years.
Officials in both countries said they had yet to receive reports from the remote Himalayan areas hardest hit by the temblor, which knocked out power and communications and was said to injure at least 3,000 people.
Niranjan Thapa, Nepal's minister of state for home affairs, told a news conference at least 450 were dead and up to 1,000 injured.
He said officials expected the numbers to climb.
The quake, centered almost on the India-Nepal border, registered 6.5 on the Richter scale.
Medical teams in India carried medicine and other supplies to overcrowded hospitals and the army was deployed to help search for victims.
But the monsoons, which hit the subcontinent in late June and usually last through September, hampered relief operations.
Nepal's Thapa told a news conference that ``the rains have been a great hindrance in carrying out rescue works.
The hardest hit appeared to be Dharan, a sparsely populated border region where Thapa said at least 131 people died.
Bir Bahadur Shahi, secretary of the home affairs ministry, flew to eastern Nepal on Sunday.
Witnesses in Darbhanga, an Indian city of 800,000 about 45 miles south of the epicenter, said the only warnings were hissing sounds, rattling doors and cracking windows.
