TONIGHT in the big stadium in Barcelona the athletics is dominated by the four relay finals.
What the relays demonstrate more clearly than any other athletics event is that at the Olympics the race has traditionally gone to affluent countries - or to those, rather, that choose to lavish resources on athletes.
The US has comfortably won the most relay medals, followed by Britain, the former Soviet Union, the former West Germany (not even counting the six won before 1939), the former East Germany, France and Canada.
Britain alone have won more relay medals (23) than all the Caribbean islands (nine) and Africa (four, including one for South Africa).
The Dutch, with one, have more relay medals than all the nations of Asia (nil) and South America (nil) combined.
In the 4x100m heats James Jett replaced Carl Lewis but Lewis ran impressively in last night's semi-final and tonight will pursue his eighth Olympic gold.
When Voula Patoulidou, looking up at the giant video screen after the women's 100m hurdle final, suddenly realised, to her astonishment, that she had won a gold medal, she went delightfully and utterly potty, as did the other 25 Greeks in the stadium, including Queen Sofia of Spain.
