Virginia Thomas is a soft-spoken, hard-working daughter of the heartland.
A brainy Omaha, Neb., lawyer who has scaled the sheer cliffs of professional Washington.
A churchgoer who invites homeless people out to lunch.
Her critics see her as more than the supportive spouse who'll accompany her husband, Clarence, through his Senate confirmation hearings, which began Tuesday and are likely to run through next week.
Some religious rights groups are troubled by her anti-cult activities in light of her former involvement with Lifespring, a motivational group.
The fact that she is white has drawn criticism from some blacks who see the marriage as evidence that Clarence Thomas has rejected his roots.
"I don't think it's fair to say she's anti-women's rights," said Ricky Silberman, vice chairwoman of the EEOC and a friend of the Thomases.
She said Virginia Thomas opposed legislation on comparable worth because it would have involved the government in determining wages, which is "not good for the economy, not good for workers, not good for women."
Virginia Thomas has represented the conservative viewpoint in her jobs as a staffer for a Republican congressman, spokeswoman at the U.S. Chamber of Congress and deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Labor.
Clarence Thomas advocates a colorblind society, and his marriage may be an example of that philosophy.
