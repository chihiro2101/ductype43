Free enterprise has collided with the Academy Awards, and everybody's trying to pick up the pieces.
With Oscar statuettes selling at auction for more than $10,000 and a Chicago trophy company casting alleged Academy Award clones, the National Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is scrambling to make sure Oscar's golden sheen isn't tarnished by Hollywood hucksterism.
``It seemed like a good marketing opportunity,'' said Coca-Cola spokesman Ira Gleser.
``The Academy approached our local bottler in Los Angeles and said we're going to have a lot of thirsty people.''
But even as the Academy embraces this new intrusion of merchandising, it has lashed out at whatever else it considers a blemishing of the Oscar name.
When MGM-UA, the distributor of ``Rain Man,'' published newspaper advertisements touting the film's Oscar nominations before the nominations were even announced, the Academy issued a harsh statement condemning MGM-UA's promotional gamble.
``We regard this as a serious matter, and we have communicated our concern,'' said Richard Kahn, president of the Academy.
The Academy insists that a contract signed by Oscar winners mandates that they will not sell the trophies without first offering them to the Academy for a nominal fee.
The Academy had claimed the Lone Star Statuette, designed and built by Chicago's Creative House Promotions, was ``practically identical'' to the Oscar.
