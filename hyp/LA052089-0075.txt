President Corazon Aquino said Friday that for security reasons she would not permit deposed President Ferdinand E. Marcos to be buried in the Philippines.
Marcos was reported to be in "very critical condition" in Honolulu, where he has lived in exile since his ouster in 1986.
Hospital officials there said that he rallied slightly Friday but remained in extremely critical condition.
The 71-year-old former president has been suffering from heart, lung and kidney disorders as well as pneumonia.
His frail body attached to a respirator and a hemodialysis blood-cleansing machine, Marcos is unconscious most of the time but occasionally shows faint signs of life, doctors in Hawaii said.
Medical sources said that he is being treated with antibiotics and heart medication but that he could die at "any time."
Despite charges that Marcos and his inner circle looted the government treasury of billions of dollars, the former president still has a significant following here.
Aquino's national security adviser, Rafael Ileto, told reporters Friday that the Philippine army is prepared for any emergency that might be provoked by the death of the former president.
