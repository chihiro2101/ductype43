In addition to the Leonard Bernstein tribute that is part of the Los Angeles Philharmonic program this weekend, other local orchestras are also planning special remembrances.
Sunday at Royce Hall, the American Youth Symphony has added local composer Leon Levitch's Elegy for Strings -- a personal choice from conductor Mehli Mehta -- to the program to honor Bernstein, who died last Sunday.
Also, opening the new season of the Glendale Symphony season on Sunday at Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, music director Lalo Schifrin will observe a moment of silence to honor his longtime friend and colleague.
Last Monday, KUSC-FM (91.5) devoted its entire day of live broadcasting, from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., to performances -- as conductor and pianist -- and compositions of Bernstein, including an unusual recording from 1956 of him discussing Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.
The outpouring of emotions following Bernstein's death filled almost 200 lines (15 inches of small type) and encompassed 14 separate tributes.
