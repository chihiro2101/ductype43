Employees at a jewelry store huddled in the vault while the shop came down around them.
A man in an apartment building stayed in his bathtub while the bathroom walls crumbled and fell.
``Everybody was screaming and windows started breaking and the roof started to fall,'' recalled Vincent Davis, a fourth-grader at Jones Valley Elementary School.
``The whole top story flew off.
He was taken to a hospital with minor injuries; five of about 30 children in a kindergarten class also were reported hurt.
Lynn Culpepper was in his bathtub at the Waterford Square apartments, where at least a dozen buildings were destroyed.
When I opened my eyes and looked around, there was just a pile of rubble where the apartments used to be.''
Manager Bob Husman of a Golbro jewelry store ordered employees into the vault shortly before the roof and walls crashed down on him, 20 feet from the vault.
For Ed Rolan, a medic, the devastation brought back memories of Vietnam.
Rolan, who was driving home when the tornado hit, went right to work helping the stricken motorists around him.
