A deep-sea inspection of the Bismarck suggests that the most powerful battleship in Adolf Hitler's navy was scuttled by its own crew rather than sunk by the British in a celebrated battle, underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard said Thursday.
During a 90-minute news conference, Ballard described how he his ocean-crawling robot located the Bismarck ``sitting upright and proud'' two weeks ago.
Then the American oceanographer, whose father was of British background and whose mother was of German heritage, addressed himself to the German people in German.
He said he will disclose its exact location only to Germany so Germans themselves can decide whether to try to raise the ship, which sank after a battle May 27, 1941.
``Only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one piece,'' Ballard said.
``Maybe the Germans didn't want it taken as a war prize,'' he added.
Hitler apparently wanted to keep the British from learning the secrets of the Graf Spee's construction and weapons.
Again, he speculated, perhaps the Germans did not want the ship's technologically advanced equipment to fall into British hands.
The Bismarck was found by Ballard in more than 15,000 feet of water about 600 miles west of Brest, France.
