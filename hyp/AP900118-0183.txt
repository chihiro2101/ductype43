Thursday's acquittals in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case outraged parents who said prosecutors botched it, while those on the defense side proclaimed a triumph of justice over hysteria and hype.
Mother-and-son defendants Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, and Raymond Buckey, 31, wept as the verdicts were announced.
Jurors found the pair innocent of 52 charges and couldn't reach a verdict on 13 other counts.
Prosecutors must decide whether to try those charges in a new trial.

But several parents of former students at the school said the Buckeys won because the system lost.
``It was never done properly,'' said parent Alan Lagunoff, who moved to Central California from suburban Manhattan Beach.
``I don't think it's worth it to bring this thing back into the courts.

Also criticized was the decision by investigators to use a private child therapy group, Children's Institute International, to conduct the original interviews with the children.
Originally, there were seven defendants, including Raymond Buckey's sister, Peggy Ann Buckey, and Virginia McMartin, the founder of the school, mother of Mrs. Buckey and grandmother of Raymond Buckey.
Hundreds of allegations of child molestation were filed in the case, which gained worldwide attention with its tales of underground tunnels at the school and Satanic rituals.
``It took far too long and cost far too much money to have what has been called perfect justice.
Superior Court Judge William Pounders said he did what he could to limit its length, cutting 50 witnesses and narrowing the scope of the case.
