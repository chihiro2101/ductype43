President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met Tuesday with East German Premier Hans Modrow and appeared to be more open toward eventual German reunification.
Modrow told reporters after the meeting that Gorbachev ``did not rule out such a prospect in the future, and at the same time did not venture to set some time limits for that.''
Earlier, the Kremlin chief said any such decisions must include the four Allied powers and take into account European opinions.
``The development of events in the world, in East Germany, in the Soviet Union demand deep consideration and an analytical approach to deciding this problem,'' he said in remarks reported by the official news agency Tass.
``Time itself is acting on this process, giving it dynamism,'' Gorbachev said.
Gorbachev, in comments to reporters after meeting French President Francois Mitterrand in Kiev in December, reiterated his view that the existence of two German states is a fact based on the outcome of World War II.
According to Tass, the Soviet leader said any action on reunification must not infringe on the interests of either East or West Germany, the four Allied powers: France, Britain, the United States or the Soviet Union, or anyone else in Europe.
Count Otto Lambsdorff, head of West Germany's Free Democratic Party, a partner in the governing coalition, said Tuesday in London that Gorbachev has adopted ``a more positive attitude'' toward German reunification.
