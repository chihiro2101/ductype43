On the stage where Leonard Bernstein made his sensational New York Philharmonic conducting debut 47 years ago, the orchestra remembered the maestro at a concert that included selections from his ``Mass'' and ``Chichester Psalms.''
Wednesday's midday concert at Carnegie Hall also came on the 90th birthday of the late composer-conductor's close friend, Aaron Copland.
Speakers, introducing various selections and often quoting from Bernstein's writings, included Bernstein's three children, son-in-law and friends Lauren Bacall and Schuyler Chapin.
Singers were the Westminster Choir, mezzo-sopranos Marilyn Horne and Christa Ludwig, soprano Clamma Dale, tenor Jerry Hadley and baritones Thomas Hampson and Chester Ludgin.
