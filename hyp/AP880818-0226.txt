Here is a transcript of the speech by Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas nominating Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana for vice president at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night.
Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, four of my congressional colleagues and I are here for the purpose of nominating the next vice president of the United States.
And almost every one of these letters asks for help with some problem.
I knew Corinne Quayle was from a political family because she invited me to come along, too.
Corinne and her brothers, Tucker and Benjamin, and their mother, Marilyn, share Dan Quayle with the people of Indiana and the United States Senate.
And whenever I needed him, whenever I needed him, Dan was there _ ready and willing to make the tough choices, to cast the tough votes, to transform President Reagan's vision of America into the law of the land.
And now he is ready to carry that revolution forward.
I am honored to nominate him for vice president, Mr. Chairman.
