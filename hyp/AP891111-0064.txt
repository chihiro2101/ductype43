The concept of a reunified Germany enjoys support from the United States and other countries but some analysts believe the consequences of a political and economic German superstate could have an unsettling effect throughout Europe.
The lifting of travel restrictions by East Germany on Thursday has breathed new life into the idea of a single German state, drawing expressions of support from the Bush administration and others.
But Soviet affairs expert William Hyland says that despite these assertions, a reunified Germany is ``really terrifying to most of the countries involved, to the West Germans, to the United States, Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia.
``No one really wants German unity except the East German people, and they turn out to be the decisive factor,'' says Hyland, a one-time top aide to former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.
While a recurrence of that nightmare seems remote at best under any scenario, an undivided Germany could become the unchallenged economic and political force on the continent.
The official U.S. policy on the reunification question was outlined last Thursday by State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher.
As former National Security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski sees it, the reunification issue will become ``very, very active'' if a freely elected government takes power in East Germany.
Brzezinski asks: ``How do we arrange for the unification of Germany, so that it doesn't become destabilizing, so it isn't a threat to Germany's neighbors _ France, Poland, Czechoslovakia?
