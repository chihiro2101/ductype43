Thousands of Lucille Ball's fans shed tears for the woman who made them laugh, as three cities held memorial services in which the redheaded comedian was remembered with prayers and applause.
``She was a whole package.
I love her,'' said a tearful Carol Burnett following a memorial Mass in suburban Santa Monica.
More than a thousand people who packed the St. Monica's Catholic Church rose to their feet and clapped for several minutes after television minister the Rev. Robert Schuller asked them to ``applaud the Lord for Lucille Ball.''
All three memorial Masses began at 8 p.m. Monday, the time Miss Ball's three most popular programs were often broadcast.
``She showed her love in the only way she knew how, by making you laugh,'' the Rev. James Fox told those gathered for the Roman Catholic Mass at St. Ignatius Loyola in New York.
Broadcaster Diane Sawyer told the crowd that the death of Miss Ball may have settled a longstanding theological debate over whether there is laughter in heaven.
In Chicago, the Rev. Jack Wall told people at Old St. Patrick Church that God gave the world talents like Miss Ball ``to show us life is not a tragedy, but a comedy with a happy ending.''
