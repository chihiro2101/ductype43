THE annual Booker ballyhoo got going again yesterday when the judges for this year's Pounds 20,000 prize for British (and Commonwealth) fiction announced the shortlist.

Its critics say that the autumn brouhaha distorts the annual fiction industry and the intense media hype of the shortlisted authors does a disservice to the hordes of other gifted but unlisted writers.
