Residents took forecasters at their word when they warned of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number of deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy respect, authorities said.
The storm, which caused billions in damage, claimed 17 lives in South Carolina, and only two were in the Charleston area, which bore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds.
``We just feel very thankful about that,'' said Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.
``Several thousands of people who were in the shelters and the tens of thousands of people who evacuated inland were potential victims of injury and death.''
``We've had so many close calls,'' said Gary Garnet, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
