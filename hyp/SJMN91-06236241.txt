Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin today pressed ahead with a sweeping purge of coup supporters, and the Communist Party suffered a series of stunning blows for not opposing the coup plotters.
Gorbachev threw out his foreign minister, Alexander Bessmertnykh, and the Communist Party was banned from the KGB, which for decades helped enforce Communist rule.
They wanted to annihilate us, and for that they must bear the severe responsibility," the Soviet president said.
He accused the Communist Party Central Committee of panicking during the coup.
Gorbachev named a series of well-known reformers to the posts of those who were fired.
In his speech, Gorbachev praised "the outstanding role" of Yeltsin, his sometimes adversary, in halting the hard-line Communist coup.
Yeltsin has been a strong foe of Communist Party influence in the country
Gorbachev, however, warned in his speech against "any kind of anti-Communist hysteria."
Yeltsin commented frequently during Gorbachev's speech, and Gorbachev deferred to him several times on details of what happened while Gorbachev was in detention.
As the face of the Soviet government continued to change in the aftermath of the 63-hour coup, hundreds of angry citizens marched toward Communist Party headquarters in Moscow intent on proving the party was behind the coup.
Yeltsin, who led the nationwide coup resistance, today nationalized the hundreds of printing plants in the Russian republic.
Bessmertnykh, 57, was the latest official to step down or be removed after the failed takeover.
Also dismissed was Soviet parliamentary speaker Anatoly Lukyanov, whom Yeltsin had named as the chief ideologue of the plotters.
