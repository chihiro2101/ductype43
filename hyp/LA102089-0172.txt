On Telegraph Hill, Jerry Lubenow got his biggest shock when he arrived at his apartment after the deadly earthquake.
"There was no damage to our place or in our neighborhood," he said.
He then talked to friends who live on Nob Hill and Russian Hill, which are also situated on rock, and learned that their residences also avoided damage.
"You almost feel guilty," he said, referring to his own good fortune. "
(It's) like living through the blitz in London in the Second World War."
Only a few miles away in San Francisco's affluent Marina District, dozens of fashionable townhouses were damaged or destroyed.
Others appeared outwardly sound but sustained interior damage that rendered them uninhabitable.
Why did high-rises that form the elegant San Francisco skyline escape virtually unscathed while an office building in the city's southeast district peel apart, killing five pedestrians below?
"They were on top of the worst soil conditions in the city," explained Yanev, who said he has traveled to "all the major earthquakes" in the last 20 years studying their impact on construction.
The soil beneath the Marina District, where six buildings burned down or collapsed, is made up of landfill partly dredged from the bay more than 70 years ago.
You effectively have no walls on one side of the building.
Experts said they did not anticipate that the Marina District would be the major problem in an earthquake.
Chinatown survived relatively intact, Yanev said, because it is located "up in the hills" atop "very firm soil," and the epicenter of the temblor was many miles away.
"Some of the buildings are extremely hazardous," Assistant Fire Chief Frank Blackburn said.
