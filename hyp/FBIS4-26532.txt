[Text] Comrade Wen Jiabao [member of CPC Central Committee Secretariat] and his party left Changsha for Zhuzhou and Xiangtan yesterday.
He inspected the flooded areas, including Zhuzhou City's Xiawan dike, the Hexi New and High Technology Development Zone, and Linghuayuan and Xiangtan's Yangtianhu, Xingxiadi, Zhoujiangdi, and Shiwandalou, where rescue and relief work was in full swing.
Comrade Wen Jiabao fully affirmed the initial victories that the two cities have scored in their flood fighting and relief work under the leadership of the provincial party committee and government.
In the next step, we should earnestly draw a lesson from this negative experience.
