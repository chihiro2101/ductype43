Coal miners in Siberia ended their strike today after exacting promises of better food, housing and working conditions, but the wave of unrest they launched continued in other key coal regions.
Some of the 150,000 miners who went on strike last week in Siberia's Kuznetsk coal basin region returned to work Thursday, and the rest went back today, strike leaders and the official Tass news agency said.
In the largest coal region, the Donetsk Coal Basin of the Ukraine, more than 300,000 miners were on strike, the deputy minister of the coal industry, Alexander P. Fisun, told Izvestia.
In the Karaganda region of the southern republic of Kazakhstan, the Soviet Union's third-biggest coal-producing area, all 26 mines were at a standstill, and miners made more than 70 demands, Izvestia said.
Strikes were also reported in the Pechora Coal Basin in the Russian republic, and Chervonograd in the western Ukraine, official media said.
Gorbachev has expressed sympathy for the strikers and placed much of the blame for the miners' deteriorating working and living conditions on leaders of the officially sanctioned trade unions.
On Wednesday, the Kuznetsk strike committee and members of a high-level government commission signed an agreement meeting many demands.
Tass said late Thursday that strikes had ended at six mines in the Donetsk region but that most mines in the area remained on strike.
``The Coal Mining Ministry will continue to run the mines, but the miners will have a much greater say setting production levels and allocating the profits,'' he said.
