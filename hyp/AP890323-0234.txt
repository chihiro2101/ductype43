The store manager of the Wal-Mart in this community on the outskirts of Dallas tells a story that gives an insight into the man considered responsible for a retailing phenomenon.
Manager Don Bost remembers one day last summer when a secretary telephoned from Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s corporate headquarters in Bentonville, Ark. Chairman Sam Walton was about to land at a nearby airport and the secretary asked if someone could fetch him and bring him to the De Soto store.
Paying unexpected calls on stores is one way Walton has kept in close touch with everyday goings-on.
His example is followed by other Wal-Mart executives and most make a point of spending a lot of time in the field.
Says Ed Nagy, district manager for 9 stores in the Dallas metropolitan area, ``It's not like `Uh-oh, someone's coming,' because they're always out.''
Everyone, from Wal-Mart President and Chief Operating Officer David Glass down to an hourly store worker, can readily quote the gospel according to Sam, as he is called.
He also regularly reminds Wal-Mart ``associates'' that hospitality to customers is crucial.
He graduated from the University of Missouri with an economics degree in 1940 and joined J.C. Penney Co. as a management trainee in Des Moines, Iowa.
The seeds of the Wal-Mart empire were sown when Sam and his brother James L., or Bud, opened the first Wal-Mart Discount City in 1962.
Sam hasn't slowed much, enjoying hunting and tennis as much as ever, and is said not to suffer after effects from a bout with leukemia, now in remission.
