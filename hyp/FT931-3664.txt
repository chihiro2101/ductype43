MR TEG BAHADUR Thapar was serving lunch from his stall outside the Bombay stock exchange on Friday when he was showered with flying glass and broken concrete in one of 13 explosions which rocked the city and left at least 255 people killed and over 1,200 injured. '
Across Bombay people were asking themselves the same questions this weekend.
They sensed there was an enormous difference from the riots which scarred the city in December and again in January.
The weapons used were mostly primitive - knives, clubs and petrol bottles.
Friday's outrage, by contrast, bears the deadly stamp of high-technology terrorism, complete with Semtex plastic explosive, high-grade timers, efficient organisation and money.
But that was a single bomb aimed at one man - the explosions in Bombay were designed to terrorise the nation's commercial capital.
Bombay accounts for 35 per cent of India's exports.
Breaking diplomatic relations would be the minimum step Delhi could take on a dangerous road.
Bombayites seemed determined to put the outrage behind them.
