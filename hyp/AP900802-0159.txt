An emergency Arab League Council failed to publicly condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Thursday and adjourned its meeting for 24 hours as Arab leaders held urgent consultations on how to handle the crisis.
Kuwait's Cabinet affairs minister, Abdel-Rahman el-Awadi told reporters he asked the 21-nation Arab League to condemn the attack.
He accused Iraq of using the ``laws of the jungle.''
President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein met in Alexandria and telephoned Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, President Bush, Saudi King Fahd and Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh on the crisis.
Sources close to the Arab League Council said its members agreed to convene an emergency Arab summit but decided to leave the when and where up to Arab leaders.
Following its evening session, attended by Saadoon Hamadi, a member of the Iraqi Revolutionary Council, Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid of Egypt told reporters the Council would meet again Friday.
A conference source said several Arab foreign ministers replied that ``they considered this to be an Iraqi invasion which is against all United Nations and Arab League conventions.''
MENA said Kuwait invoked the 1950 Arab joint defense pact and asked the Arab League Council to dispatch a joint Arab force to ``defend Kuwait against the invasion.''
