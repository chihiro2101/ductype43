Seven years late, the Hubble Space Telescope is where it belongs, out of this world and in search of others so distant that they may have been formed at the beginning of time.
Less than five hours after it rode into space aboard the shuttle Discovery on Tuesday, the $1.5 billion telescope sent its first test radio signal.
At the sign of life, applause and cheers erupted in Mission Control in Houston.
``As near as we can tell, everything looks perfect,'' said astronaut Steve Hawley from the shuttle.
Hawley's job on Wednesday will be to drop the telescope overboard for a 15-year stay in space.
Discovery, trailing an arc of white smoke into a brilliant blue sky, carried the silver-colored telescope to an orbit 380 miles above Earth _ higher by 70 miles than any previous shuttle.
NASA launch commentator George Diller exulted as the Discovery rose off its seaside launch pad.
``It's a beautiful day to have Hubble Space Telescope in orbit instead of here on Earth like it's been for so many years,'' said NASA administrator Richard Truly.
In its first day in space, that checkout and testing continued remotely under control of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.
``Somebody the other day said, `Who remembers the day that Galileo picked up his telescope to look at the stars?'''
When it flies free, it will receive electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two wing-like solar arrays that extend outward on each side.
Discovery's launch was not without its problems.
