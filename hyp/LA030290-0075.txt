Try to think of Sunday's Los Angeles Marathon less as a "happening," which it surely is; or a world-class athletic event, which it may become but is not now.
Look at it more as a moving advertising opportunity, human billboards running 26.2 miles through the city on live television.
With that kind of exposure to a potential 12 million Southern Californians, it's no wonder that in only five years the L. A. Marathon has become the best-marketed, slickest, most modern and sponsor-driven of the world's major marathons.
It may not be an overstatement that the L. A. Marathon is one of the country's best-marketed sports events of any kind.
Depending on your point of view, this may or may not be good news.
However, they do generate a tremendous amount of money for all concerned.
Mercedes provides automobiles for the top male and female finishers.
According to Will Kern, director of Times special events, this year's marathon has received almost $500,000 worth of donated advertising space.
According to Mary Reiling, national event manager for AT&amp;T, the L.A. Marathon's "sponsor-friendly" approach is a big incentive.
In fact, television makes the race more attractive to sponsors, who figure to multiply their exposure.
