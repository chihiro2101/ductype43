The Chinese government says that 300 soldiers, ``thugs,'' bystanders and students have been killed during the martial law occupation of Beijing.
But most other estimates of casualties are far higher.
State Council spokesman Yuan Mu said on Tuesday that 7,000 people, including 5,000 soldiers, have been injured and 400 other soldiers are missing and may be dead or wounded.
Non-official sources say Yuan's figures on civilian casualties are far too low, but most have different estimates on the number of victims.
One doctor said Sunday that a quick check of 10 hospitals placed the death toll at 500.
Some officials of China's Red Cross said 2,600 people were killed but Beijing's Red Cross office has refused to provide any figures.
An Eastern European diplomat, whose country has good relations with China, insisted that 12,000 people were slain by soldiers as they attacked protesters in Tiananmen Square.
