Chief Petty Officer Lance Vickery recalls waves tumbling into the stern of the bobbing ferry headed back to the USS Saratoga and joking, ``Whoa, looks like we're flooding.''
Only minutes later, his words came true, turning a simple ride back from Christmas shore leave into a harrowing fight to survive.
The Israeli ferry Tuvia capsized shortly after midnight on Saturday, throwing more than 100 men into the cold waters of Haifa Bay.
Vickery, 33, was among four American sailors interviewed at Haifa's Rambam Hospital.
The 13-year veteran sailor found himself trapped in the ferry's cabin, frantically struggling to find a window as the ship sank.
``I started breathing in water and almost died,'' Vickery said.
When he made his way to the surface he found ``guys floating everywhere, screaming and yelling like chaos.''
``So they just dragged us through the water back to the Saratoga, and I was a real happy person to see those guys snatching me up,'' he said.
As Vickery was being treated for bleeding lungs caused by water inhalation, his hospital roommate, Seaman Michael Benjamin, 19, of San Antonio, Texas, was recovering from a neck injury suffered when a rescue boat hit him while he was in the water.
Two other men interviewed at Rambam Hospital identified themselves as Technician John Richards, 31, of Twin Lake, Mich., and Airman Lamont Jones, 20, of Claremont, Va.
``All I can remember thinking is, `Oh my God, it's sinking,' and then I was scrambling for my life,'' he said faintly.
