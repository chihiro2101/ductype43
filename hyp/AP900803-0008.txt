Here is a brief chronology in the dispute between Iraq and Kuwait over oil production and their common border.
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein accuses Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of flooding the oil market and driving prices down, and that the move cost Iraq $14 billion in lost oil revenue.
He further charges that Arab states in the Persian Gulf are conspiring with the United States and Israel to weaken Iraq's economy and undermine its military buildup.
Kuwaiti officials suggest Iraq's sudden outburst of belligerence is aimed at getting its creditors _ including Kuwait _ to write off billions of dollars in debts from the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
