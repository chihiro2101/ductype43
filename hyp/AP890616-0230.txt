More than 10,000 coal miners in four states were off the job today to express sympathy for miners in Virginia and West Virginia who have waged a bitter strike since April against the Pittston Coal Group.
Miners in Pennsylvania and Kentucky today became the third and fourth states to report walkouts at coal companies.
The sympathy strikes began Monday in West Virginia and spread to Indiana late Thursday.
One United Mine Workers representative said today that the Indiana walkout was prompted by Thursday night's telecast of CBS' ``48 Hours,'' which focused on the Pittston strike, in which 1,600 miners have been off the job since April.
Pittston dropped out of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association to negotiate with the union independently, and the two sides have failed to reach an agreement despite 16 months of negotiations.
Quenon flew to Charleston from St. Louis on Thursday to meet with reporters and express Peabody's and the association's concerns about the walkout.
Most worked for Rochester &amp; Pittsburgh Coal Co. operations in central Pennsylvania, where 1,600 miners failed to report for work at midnight Thursday, said company spokesman Hank Waneck said.
Mark Arnold, a spokesman for UMW District 11 in Terre Haute, attributed the action to the CBS show.
