Three of President Bush's ambassadorial nominees, whom Democrats said had no qualifications except political connections, won narrow approval Tuesday from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Sen. Charles S. Robb (D-Va.) joined the Republican members as the panel first voted, 10 to 9, to send to the Senate floor the nomination of Florida real estate developer Joseph Zappala to be ambassador to Spain.
Robb said later that he was troubled over Zappala's "quite thin" qualifications for the job but that he felt he had made an "implicit" commitment to vote for the nominee when he interviewed him May 11 and did not clearly indicate that he would oppose him.
It also approved the nominations of Thomas Melady to be ambassador to the Vatican, William Howard Taft IV to be the permanent U.S. representative on the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Keith L. Brown to be ambassador to Denmark, and Joseph Gildenhorn, a Washington lawyer and real estate developer, to be ambassador to Switzerland.
