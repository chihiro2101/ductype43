Margaret Thatcher set the example of what a woman could achieve in British society, but her critics say she did little else to help women along.
One woman wrote to The Independent newspaper last week that her 7-year-old daughter wondered what title Mrs. Thatcher's successor would hold, since ``he couldn't be called prime minister, that's a girl's name.''
Emma Nicholson, a Conservative Party lawmaker, said it was once unthinkable that a woman would ever be a British prime minister.
Mrs. Thatcher, who trained as a chemist before studying law, said she viewed herself as prime minister, not as a woman.
Mrs. Thatcher, who stepped down on Thursday, urged women to get involved in politics, but did little to pull them up the ladder.
``The truth is that although Mrs. Thatcher is a woman, she doesn't believe in the advancement of women,''
Clare Short, a Labor Party lawmaker, said last month.
Mrs. Currie said last week.
However, campaigners for women rights say there are encouraging signs at the grassroots.
