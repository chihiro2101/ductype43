ONE year ago tomorrow, Mr John Major surprised everyone but himself by winning the general election.
His honeymoon, after a very personal victory, was short-lived and now he begins the second year of his hard-won term as a deeply unpopular leader who has everything still to prove.
The past 12 months have been hijacked by internal party differences over Europe, by the debacle surrounding UK withdrawal from the exchange rates mechanism of the European Monetary System, and by a continuing, deep recession which has disappointed and alienated many traditional Tory supporters in business.
Mr Major's anniversary inevitably led yesterday to an outbreak of political point-scoring over the government's record.
While Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, conceded: 'No one pretends that the last year has been easy,' he also claimed that much had been achieved.
Tory allegiances in the business world have also been put under immense pressure, though criticism over policy drift and inaction may soften as recession ends.
Yesterday Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry, remained cautious but volunteered: 'If I were a betting man I would say we have the embryo of a recovery.'
