The U.N. Security Council today overwhelmingly approved sweeping trade and military sanctions against Iraq, including a ban on oil purchases, to punish Baghdad for invading Kuwait.
The vote was 13-0, with two abstentions by Cuba and Yemen on the 15-member council, which adopted the sanctions resolution proposed by the United States.
It said Iraq had launched an armed attack against Kuwait and usurped the authority of Kuwait's legitimate government.
The sanctions were intended to force Iraq to withdraw its troops from Kuwait and the resolution bans ``the import into their territories of all commodities and products originating in Iraq or Kuwait and exported there from after the date of this resolution.''
The vote followed similar sanctions imposed on Iraq by much of the West, including the United States, Japan and the European Community.
The 10 non-permanent members are: Canada, Colombia, Cuba, Ethiopia, Finland, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Romania, Yemen and Zaire.
