Drummer Andy Newmark was touring with Roxy Music in the summer of 1980 when he got the call that changed his life: He was to play on John Lennon's new album.
Lennon had been in virtual seclusion for five years, busy taking care of his son, Sean, and admittedly out of songwriting ideas.
But in 1980, he suddenly felt inspired again and planned to return to the studio to make an album with his wife, Yoko Ono.
Afterall, Lennon gave no press conferences, and didn't attend clubs or concerts.
Producer Jack Douglas, who had worked with Lennon as an engineer, recruited Newmark, bassist Tony Levin, guitarist Hugh McCracken and other New York-based sessions players.
Recording was to take place at the Hit Factory in Manhattan.
To Newmark, Lennon was a hero and only a hero.
I didn't see anything that seemed startlingly new to the myth.
It just appeared to be what we had imagined: down to earth, direct, so direct it could not offend people.''
Once recording began, Lennon was just a ``working musician'' with the same goal as everyone else: finishing the album.
Between takes, Lennon jammed on Buddy Holly songs and played host.
By the fall, Newmark had finished working on the album, and his contact with Lennon was limited to an occasional visit to the studio.
``Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans,'' Lennon once sang.
When he thinks about it now, it's not so much a particular song that hurts him, it's the day-to-day stuff: the jokes and wisecracks, the coffee and the stories.
``He was totally friendly and open to everybody, including the janitor.
