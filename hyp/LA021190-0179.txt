World leaders welcomed South Africa's announcement Saturday of Nelson R. Mandela's impending release from prison, and international rejoicing began to build for an event so long awaited by so many.
Britain said it is time to resume contacts with internationally isolated South Africa, but anti-apartheid campaigners warned against any reduction of pressure on the white-led government.
President Bush praised South African President Frederik W. de Klerk for "bold and imaginative leadership," and the Canadian government expressed delight at the announcement that Mandela would be released today.
In Lusaka, Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda, whose country has been a refuge for the exiled leadership of Mandela's African National Congress, said his first reaction was to kneel down and thank God.
"Really, we must believe in the leadership of the people of South Africa to put their heads together and build on these developments," Kaunda said.
In the Soviet Union, Moscow Radio broadcast news of the announcement, then added: "Nelson Mandela has become the world's most famous political prisoner, put in jail for the struggle against apartheid in South Africa."
