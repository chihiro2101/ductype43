Discovery's five astronauts returned Sunday for a second attempt to launch the shuttle with NASA's most valuable and celebrated payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.
Discovery is scheduled to lift off at 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday.
``We feel very confident that things are going to go well this time,'' said Discovery's commander, Air Force Col.
``We're going to come out OK on Tuesday morning and, if not, we'll just keep trying until we do.
NASA test director Mike Leinbach said Sunday that the countdown was proceeding smoothly and the shuttle appeared to be in perfect condition.
A 70 percent chance of favorable weather was expected at launch time, with low clouds being the main concern, said the Air Force's Ed Priselac, shuttle weather officer.
Columbia commander Vance Brand said he does not believe the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is moving too fast with his shuttle.
NASA expects to launch Columbia with an astronomical observatory called Astro no earlier than May 16, one week later than planned because of Discovery's two-week delay.
The $100 million observatory also will focus during Columbia's nine-day mission on Comet Austin, believed to be on its first trip through the solar system.
