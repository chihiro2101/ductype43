Ever since the 1906 earthquake devastated San Francisco, many scientists have believed the next ``big one'' would strike the Los Angeles end of the mighty San Andreas Fault.
But studies in recent years have reminded the Bay Area that it also faced another seismic disaster, and those studies became a reality Tuesday when a quake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale rocked the Bay area.
A 1985 paper in the Geophysical Research Letters predicted a 6.9-magnitude quake could happen any time on a portion of the San Andreas Fault that stretches 50 miles from Palo Alto southward through the Santa Cruz Mountains and on to San Juan Bautista.
The epicenter of the quake was about 8 miles northeast of Santa Cruz and 75 miles south of San Francisco.
The 1985 study, by Columbia University geology professor Christopher Scholz, was among several that produced conflicting estimates on the likelihood and size of the quake that finally happened Tuesday.
Scholz pointed to evidence that the 1906 quake didn't relieve as much stress in the Santa Cruz Mountains as other scientists believed.
