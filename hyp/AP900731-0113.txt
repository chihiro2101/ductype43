Kuwaiti and Iraqi negotiators embraced warmly Tuesday as they began talks on their oil and border dispute, sources said.
Diplomats reported that Iraq had massed 100,000 troops on Kuwait's border.
Gulf-based diplomatic sources said the Iraqi force, triple the number earlier reported, included about 300 Soviet-made tanks, and dwarfed the entire Kuwaiti army of 20,000 troops.
The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the troops have been concentrated along the border since last week, when Iraq began threatening Kuwait.
Iraq accused the small Persian Gulf state of stealing oil from a disputed border region and forcing oil prices to drop.
The delegation leaders, Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah of Kuwait, and Izzat Ibrahim, deputy chairman of Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council, met privately for two hours.
Kuwaiti and Iraqi officials agreed to meet in Jiddah after intensive mediation efforts by King Fahd and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
