In what amounted to a public apology, Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Soviet leaders today eulogized Andrei D. Sakharov as a ``man of honesty and sincerity'' who suffered great injustice at the hands of previous rulers.
An obituary signed by Gorbachev, five other members of the ruling Communist Party Politburo and 50 other leading officials and scholars was printed along with a picture of Sakharov on page 4 of the party daily Pravda.
Such obituaries are reserved for favored public figures and scientists, and Pravda emphasized the importance of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner by printing a decree about the formation of a funeral commission in a black box on its front page.
Sakharov, 68, died Thursday night in his study, just hours after urging fellow members of the Congress of People's Deputies to create a formal opposition to the party in their drive to break its seven-decade strangehold on political power.
It was signed by Gorbachev and fellow Politburo members Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, Vadim A. Medvedev, Lev N. Zaikov, Alexander N. Yakovlev and Vitaly I. Vorotnikov.
However, the signatures of several other Politburo members, including KGB chief Vladimir A. Kryuchkov and leading conservative Yegor K. Ligachev were missing.
The Soviet leader told reporters at the Congress of People's Deputies that Sakharov's death was a ``great loss.''
