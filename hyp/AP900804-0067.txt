Saudi Arabia has been subdued in its reaction to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, which places Iraqi forces near the oil-rich kingdom's border.
Oil executives said Saudi Arabia has not and will not take the most potent action possible against Iraq _ closing the pipeline that carries Iraqi oil for export across Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea.
The executives said the Saudis believe this would give Iraq's belligerent president, Saddam Hussein, an excuse to attack and occupy Saudi oil fields 150 miles south of Kuwait, giving Iraq control of more oil than any other country in the world.
The only direct Saudi statement since the invasion was made by an anonymous government spokesman through the official Saudi Press Agency the day after the Iraqi move.
The Saudis did condemned the invasion as part of a joint statement issued by the Gulf Cooperation Council, in which it is allied with Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain.
Iraq's 1-million-member armed forces is clearly too much for the joint 3,000-member Gulf Cooperation Council force or Saudi Arabia's 65,700-member army.
