Frustrated Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee say Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas is an evasive witness, but no groundswell of opposition to his confirmation seems to be emerging.
Several senators were openly skeptical Wednesday over Thomas' insistence that he has no opinion on the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.
Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., added, "I'm concerned about his candor, his willingness to be forthcoming."
Kohl was today's leadoff questioner as the hearings entered their third day.
Two pivotal members of the 14-member committee -- Howell Heflin, D-Ala., and Arlen Specter, R-Pa. -- also voiced concern about Thomas' answers.
But the panel's traditional third swing vote, Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said Thomas was doing well.
Heflin cited the "appearance of a confirmation conversion" and said it may raise questions of Thomas' "integrity and temperament."
DeConcini said he thought the conservative Thomas "handled the privacy questions very well" without taking a stand on abortion.
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he could not understand how Thomas' prior statements touching on the 1973 abortion decision could have been made without considering its content.
Thomas' opponents believe Republicans Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Charles Grassley of Iowa, Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Hank Brown of Colorado are solid Thomas backers.
But they hope Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, will be joined by the three swing-vote senators and Biden, Leahy, Simon and Kohl in voting against the nominee.
