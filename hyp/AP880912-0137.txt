Hurricane Gilbert slammed into Kingston on Monday with torrential rains and 115 mph winds that ripped roofs off homes and buildings, uprooted trees and downed power lines.
No serious injuries were immediately reported in the city of 750,000 people, which was hit by the full force of the hurricane around noon.
For half an hour, the hurricane lashed the city, tearing branches from trees, blowing down fences and whipping paper through the air.
The National Weather Service reported heavy damage to Kingston's airport and aircraft parked on its fields.
The first shock let up as the eye of the storm moved across the city.
A National Weather Service report said the hurricane was moving west at 17 mph with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph.
``Right now it's actually moving over Jamaica,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
Gilbert reached Jamaica after skirting southern Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
In Washington, the Navy reported its bases at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, had taken various precautionary steps but appeared to be safe from the brunt of the hurricane.
