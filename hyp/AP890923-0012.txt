The IRA bombing that killed 10 men and blew apart a building at the Royal Marines Music School outraged Britons and stirred recriminations over safety standards at the school.
A huge explosion in a barracks staff room Friday morning leveled the three-story building as bandsmen took a coffee break between practice sessions on the school's parade ground.
Twelve of the 22 people injured were hospitalized, eight of them in serious condition, police said.
They said nine of the dead were bandsmen and one other man was not immediately identified.
Although trainees at the school range in age from 16 to 20, Col. John Ware, principal director of music, said the slain bandsmen all were trained, adult musicians.
``There is a great sense of anger'' in the community, Kent police Chief Constable Paul Condon said.
Unidentified defense sources quoted by the Times newspaper today said the civilian guards were backed up by armed Marines who patrolled regularly inside the perimeter.
He said private security firms were assigned to areas considered low risks for attacks.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher received news of the bombing while aboard a jet over Siberia en route from Japan to Moscow.
The mainly Roman Catholic IRA claim gave no details of the operation, but said it was a response to a ``message of war'' delivered by Mrs. Thatcher when she visited Northern Ireland nine days ago.
