Dan Quayle's sister believes the Indiana senator won't let his candidacy for vice president hurt the family life he and his wife, Marilyn, enjoy.
``I don't think it will be tough on the family,'' said Martha Saddler, Quayle's sister, who lives in Huntington, Ind.
``Since he's been in politics, we all kind of shake our heads at his hectic schedule and wonder how he does it.
The Quayle family and friends were celebrating Tuesday afternoon after George Bush announced he wants the 41-year-old Indiana senator to be the Republican nominee for vice president.
``One of the greatest things about him is the job of being a senator has not changed him a bit,'' said Indianapolis attorney William R. Neale, treasurer of Quayle's 1986 re-election campaign.
Neale, who grew up with Marilyn Tucker Quayle in Indianapolis, introduced Dan Quayle to his future wife at a student gathering at the Indiana University law school in the early 1970s.
``His family looks like the family both parties are trying to appeal to,'' said Mitch Daniels, former political chief in the White House and now president of the Hudson Institute.
The couple, who married in 1972, have a 14-year-old son, Tucker; a 12-year-old son, Benjamin; and a 9-year-old daughter, Corinne.
