Oscar selection has come under scrutiny as film studios go to new lengths to pull votes out of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
And with the flood of Oscar vote enticements _ from free coffee mugs to complimentary buffet dinners _

``A lot of people don't know who the candidates are.
Dan Lyle, who oversees the Oscar balloting for the accounting firm Price, Waterhouse Inc., said that there is no guarantee that Academy members have actually filled out their own ballots.
The Academy's actors branch, for example, is the only group to select nominees in the four acting categories.

Reiner said that Universal Studios' all-out effort to bag votes for Sigourney Weaver, a best actress nominee for ``Gorillas in the Mist,'' could lead him to vote against the film.
