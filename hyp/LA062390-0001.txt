Shortly after 2 p.m. Wednesday, San Diego resident Mohammad Nyakoui got a call from his wife, who is spending the summer in the Caspian Sea coastal city of Rasht, Iran, with her family.
"I asked her what she was doing, and she said she was watching the World Cup," Nyakoui recalls.
About 15 minutes after she hung up, Rasht and other cities in Iran's northern region were rocked by an earthquake that killed thousands.
Back home in San Diego, it was several hours before Nyakoui even heard news of the quake.
When he did, some quick time-zone arithmetic showed that he had talked to his wife just minutes before the quake happened.
"I tried through the Red Cross to call Iran, but they told us they couldn't do anything before 48 hours passed."
"There's a sense of panic.
Already though, some of the worried immigrants were turning their fear into action by mobilizing relief efforts for Iran.
The group has set up two offices and phone lines.
Donations for Iranian earthquake relief are being taken in San Diego by two groups:
Bring items or mail checks to 4540 Kearny Villa Road, Suite 214, San Diego 92123; or to 7509 Girard Ave.,
Shipment will be sent July 2.
