Thunderstorms wreaked havoc across the middle Mississippi Valley and the Southeast on Wednesday with lethal tornadoes, wind up to 100 mph and hail up to the size of baseballs.
At least four tornadoes pounded the Huntsville, Ala., area.
One twister smashed into a residential district, a shopping area and a school, killing at least two people and causing dozens of injuries, police said.
Southern Illinois was also hard hit by the storms, with one woman killed by a falling tree, about 20 people injured and power lines downed.
Elsewhere, snow fell from the northern Rockies to the upper Great Lakes, while unseasonably mild weather continued in the East.
People in Alorton, Ill., a village of 2,700 about five miles southeast of East St. Louis, were injured when trees fell on their houses or mobile homes, said Bill Gamblin of the St. Clair County Emergency Services and Disaster Agency.
Thunderstorms crossing northeastern Arkansas whipped up high wind which blew away metal roofing being installed on a high school gymnasium at Lepanto and dumped hail up to 2 inches in diameter at Leachville.
Severe thunderstorms also developed over Alabama and South Carolina during the afternoon, and the weather service reported a tornado north of Greenwood, S.C.
