Iraqi troops have launched an offensive against Kuwait, the Kuwaiti embassy said Wednesday night.
Faleh Bader, director of the ambassador's office, said, ``We confirm there is an offensive at Kuwait border and we have no comment.''
The attack started about midnight, Kuwaiti time (5 p.m. EDT), Bader said.
Earlier in the day, the Iraqi ambassador, Mohamed Al-Mashat, was summoned to the State Department afternoon for a meeting with Assistant Secretary John Kelly.
