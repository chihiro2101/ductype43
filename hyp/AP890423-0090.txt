The scarred battleship USS Iowa made a somber return Sunday to its home port, where about 3,000 family members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an explosion that killed 47 sailors.
Sailors in whites with black arm bands lined the rails as the huge vessel docked at the Norfolk Naval Base's Pier 5 at 5:41 p.m., just one minute later than Navy officials had estimated.
``They wanted to get here on schedule and were anxious to get home,'' said Capt. Steven Karalekas.
Two of the surviving crewmen of No. 2 turret stood on top of the fire-blackened turret as the ship pulled into the pier, with full crews on the ship's two other turrets, the Navy said.
The No. 2 turret was in the same position as when the explosion occurred, facing right with the left and right guns elevated.
When the 887-foot vessel first appeared there were scattered cheers by those on the dock, but all remained silent as the ship pulled into the pier.
The violence and power of the turret explosion was shown in an amateur videotape released by the Navy on Sunday.
The tape was made by an officer on the bridge of the Iowa who wanted to record the firing of the big guns.
The detonation, which appears to blast away the gasket-like rubber ``bloomers'' that seal the turret's gun slits, is followed by a jet of intense fire and thick smoke from the front and base of the gunhouse.
Throughout the Norfolk area, churches dedicated prayers Sunday morning to the families of Iowa crewmen.

The Iowa and its sister ships, the battleships Missouri, New Jersey and Wisconsin, were commissioned during World War II and mothballed after the Korean War.
