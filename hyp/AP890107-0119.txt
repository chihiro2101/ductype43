World leaders sent Japan messages of condolences and some declared states of mourning after Emperor Hirohito's death Saturday, but painful memories of World War II still generated criticism of the Japanese monarch.
President Reagan said Hirohito's 62-year reign ``spanned one of the most tumultuous, and yet at the same time constructive eras in the history of mankind.
``It was also an era of unprecedented reconciliation.
His Majesty played a truly heroic role in bringing hostilities between our two peoples to an end,'' Reagan said, referring to Hirohito's decision to end World War II.
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union sent his ``sincere condolences'' and ``profound sympathy'' to the Japanese people.
His two-sentence telegram made no mention of wartime hostilities with what still is known officially as ``militarist Japan.''
India declared a three-day national state of mourning in honor of Hirohito and Norway's King Olav V announced a three-week court mourning.
President Francois Mitterrand of France opened an international conference on chemical weapons with a minute of silence.
