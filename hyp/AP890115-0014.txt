Deaths from heart and blood vessel disease dropped 24 percent over the past decade, but it remains by far the nation's biggest killer, taking a life every 32 seconds, the American Heart Association said Sunday.
``The good news is that we continue to see an improvement in the death rate from the biggest killer of our population,'' said Dr. Bernadine Healy of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, who is president of the heart association.
``The bad news is that heart disease is still killing almost 1 million Americans a year, and we've got a long way to go.''
The association released the statistics at its annual forum for science writers.
``The public ought to appreciate the progress that has been made in heart disease over the past 20 years,'' said Dr. Myron L. Weisfeldt of Johns Hopkins University.
Association figures indicated that in 1986 _ the most recent year for which there are statistics _ an estimated 978,500 Americans died from heart attacks, strokes and other diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
The association's figures show that more than one in four Americans suffers some form of cardiovascular disease, and almost half of those eventually die from it.
Weisfeldt said a major health goal is getting people to go to the hospital within three or four hours of the first sign of heart attacks.
The heart association estimates that cardiovascular disease will cost $88.2 billion this year in medical expenses and lost wages.
