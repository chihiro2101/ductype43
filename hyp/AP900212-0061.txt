Pakistani troops fired on Indian security forces who stopped a mob of Pakistani protesters from storming across the border into disputed Kashmir, officials said today.
At least three demonstrators were killed Sunday night, a Defense Ministry spokesman said in Islamabad.
Pakistan's state-run TV said the Indian guards killed as many as six.
The trouble started after Indian border guards opened fire on hundreds of Pakistanis who tried to cross a cease-fire line separating Pakistan-controlled Kashmir from the Indian-held region.
A spokesman for the Indian Defense Ministry said Pakistani troops then fired about 200 rounds from light and medium weapons at Indian border posts in the Uri sector.
``Pakistani military authorities and the Foreign Secretary are in touch with Indian authorities to remove the misunderstanding,'' said Additional Foreign Secretary Khalid Mahmood in Islamabad.
On Sunday, the Pakistani mob retreated when soldiers of India's paramilitary border security force opened fire, said the Indian spokesman who refused to be identified.
A Pakistani spokesman, who also refused to be identified, said Pakistani army patrols repulsed a mob of some 1,200 demonstrators.
An official of the Indian border security force, which normally patrols the border, said the Indian army today took control of the cease-fire line.
Farouk Haider, vice-president of the militant Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front that is leading the uprising, said in Islamabad after the Indian firing that ``the situation is very confusing.''
