MADE IN AMERICA:
MY STORY By Sam Walton Doubleday, Dollars 22.50.
269 pages Being an American folk hero is a tricky assignment, as Ross Perot found out.
The problem is that the great American public likes its boot-strap entrepreneurs to be very rich and very upright.
In a country where business practices are not overly genteel, this is a tough combination to achieve.
A vast media circus, meanwhile, is quick to expose any flaws.
But no one has ever been able to make Sam himself look bad.
Readers will either find his autobiography lashed with 'good ol'' common-sense and a lot of harmless, if charming, anecdotes.
But it is David Glass, Wal-Mart's current chief executive, who perhaps captures the entrepreneurial Walton spirit best.
It drove him crazy, and he got off that minnow bucket pretty quick . . . .'
Sam Walton was a salesman to the core, and seems to have packaged himself with all the skill that he once applied to selling a gooey southern sweet called Moon Pies.
But it helped me learn a lot about financing things.'
