Laughter and tears flowed freely as the Broadway theatrical community said goodby Thursday to Leonard Bernstein at the Majestic Theater.
Longtime friends and colleagues -- those who knew him as Lenny -- paid tribute to the musical-theater dynamo with heartfelt and humorous words, and often in song.
The capacity audience -- invited friends, relatives and theatrical personalities as well as 850 members of the public who started lining up at 7 a.m. -- heard recollections of an energetic Bernstein who danced until dawn in discos as well as a poignant account of his final days.
Another "West Side Story" collaborator, director-choreographer Jerome Robbins, had earned a laugh before he even spoke, thanks to Laurents' introductory words: "Fearless as Lenny was, there were two figures he did fear -- God and Jerome Robbins."
After noting that he wished he were young enough to pay homage to Bernstein by performing the sailor's variation he created in the ballet "Fancy Free," Robbins, 72, recalled that halcyon 1944 collaboration between the two 25-year-olds.
He also reflected on the joyous nature of their 1957 "West Side Story" collaboration, even while the show faced repeated obstacles before reaching Broadway.
Barbara Cook, the original Cunegonde in Bernstein's "Candide" (1956), displayed her still-gleaming voice in "A Simple Song" from Bernstein's 1971 "Mass." "Candide" itself was represented by "Glitter and Be Gay," the coloratura aria Cook made famous, as performed by Constance Haumann.
