Strikes by tens of thousands of miners in this Siberian coal region spread to four more of the Soviet Union's coal fields, Tass reported today.
The official news agency said coal miners in Vorkuta in the far north, the Don River city of Rostov in southwestern Russia and the Ukrainian industrial center of Dnepropetrovsk walked out Wednesday.
Miners in the Karaganda region in Soviet Central Asia today refused to work, Tass said.
Tass said their demands were similar to those of striking miners in the Donetsk and Kuznetsk coal basins, who are seeking greater local control over their industries and better wages and living conditions.
Kuznetsk, in western Siberia, and Donetsk, in the Ukraine, are the country's two leading coal basins and the strikes amount to the country's worst labor unrest since the 1920s.
Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a communist official in the Donetsk city of Makeyevka as saying, ``The scale of the strike is growing.
Miners in Vorkuta, Rostov and Dnepropetrovsk all walked off the job on Wednesday, Tass said.
In Dnepropetrovsk, which is 150 miles from Donetsk, workers' demands mirrored those of Donetsk and Kuznetsk miners.
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Wednesday the strikes could imperil his reforms and that there were reports of railway workers being urged to strike.
