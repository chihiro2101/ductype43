The largest family group to visit black leader Nelson Mandela since he was jailed 27 years ago gathered in Cape Town for a meeting Tuesday with the prisoner on his 71st birthday.
His wife, Winnie Mandela, arrived Monday night and indicated she did not expect Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, would be freed soon.
She said that opinion came from her husband, who she visited last week after Mandela's July 5 meeting with President P.W. Botha.
He is serving a life term after being convicted of sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-dominated government.
Mrs. Mandela, referring to her earlier visit with her husband, told reporters: ``He said from that meeting with P.W. Botha we musn't construe as indicating his release.
In addition to Mrs. Mandela the group will include three of Mandela's children, one daughter-in-law, eight grandhildren and a great-grandson.
Mandela's oldest grandson, Mandla, 14, arrived Monday evening from Swaziland where he is a student at a private school.
Makgatho Mandela came to Cape Town with his wife, Zondi, his daughter Indaba and 4-year-old Thembela, Mandela's great-grandson.
Evelyn Ntoko Mase, the cousin of ANC leader Walter Sisulu who has been imprisoned with Mandela, married Nelson Mandela in 1944.
