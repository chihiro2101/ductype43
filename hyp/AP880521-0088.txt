Greek divers have plunged 162 feet beneath the Aegean Sea and back into history, finding a treasure-laden Turkish warship sunk by Greek revolutionaries in 1822.
The remains of the wooden sailing ship were found near the island of Chios in the eastern Aegean at a point where historical accounts place the sinking of the Ottoman ship, according to Peter Nicolaides, a diver and salvage expert.
The Bourloti Seimaz _ or ``Explosives Invincible'' _ was set afire and sunk by Greek Admiral Constantine Kanaris in revenge for Turkish killing and looting on Chios.
Thousands of islanders died in the Turkish raids, which shocked other nations and swung Western European countries behind the Greek struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire.
``It's an incredible discovery, straight out of the history book we used to read in school about the War of Independence,'' Nicolaides said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press.
Nicolaides, who heard about the wreck while teaching an underwater archaeology course to local divers last winter, started querying fishermen about where their nets snagged on seabed obstacles.
American experts from the Institute of Nautical Archaeology at Texas A &amp; M University, working in cooperation with Turkish divers, have pioneered underwater excavation off the Turkish Aegean coast.
