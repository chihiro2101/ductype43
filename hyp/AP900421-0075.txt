Two weeks after a failed launch attempt, an improved Discovery is ready to embark on one of the most momentous shuttle missions, hoisting the Hubble Space Telescope high enough to behold the threshold of time.
The countdown began Saturday afternoon for a launch set for 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday.
If the launch goes on schedule and all else goes well, the first picture from Hubble could be available next weekend.
``We are as excited, maybe even more.
You can cut it with a knife, incredible,'' said Eric Chaisson, senior scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
Nothing, at least scientifically, seems to have been lost as a result of the two-week wait, one of numerous delays plaguing the mission since its original 1983 launch date.
As Chaisson remarked last week: ``The universe has been around for 15 billion years.
``I think the main point is the Hubble Space Telescope still is in perfect condition.''
NASA said it may release its first telescope image from Hubble _ of an open star cluster in the constellation Carina _ as early as that same day.
After the early test images are made and other preparatory work is done, Hubble is expected to start providing significant scientific data by satellite in a month or two.
Mission specialists Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan, veteran spacewalkers, will leave the cabin to assist if necessary.
