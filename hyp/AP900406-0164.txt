Moslem extremists abducted a leading businessman and an educator Friday and threatened to kill them, a day after authorities killed six militants crossing into Pakistan for arms and training, police said.
A telephone caller told a local reporter the abductors were also holding a third hostage and all three men would be killed within 24 hours of a Monday afternoon deadline for releasing three jailed militants.
The caller claimed to speak for the Students Liberation Front, a branch of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front fighting for autonomy in the predominantly Moslem state.
Police sources, who demanded anonymity, and the telephone caller both identified the new kidnap victims as Vice Chancellor Mushir ul-Haq of Kashmir University and L.M. Khela, general manager of Hindustan Machine Tools Co.
