The U.N. Security Council today swiftly condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, demanding an unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi troops and calling for immediate negotiations between the countries.
The Iraqi envoy said his country's troops would withdraw ``as soon as the situation is stable,'' perhaps within ``a few days or some weeks.''
The Security Council resolution was adopted 14-0 in an emergency session requested by the United States and Kuwait hours after today's pre-dawn invasion.
Neither Kuwait nor Iraq is on the 15-member council.
Britain's U.N. envoy, Crispin Tickell, condemned the invasion as an ``ugly moment in world affairs.''
``The United States has made it clear that it will stand shoulder to shoulder with Kuwait in this time of crisis,'' U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering told the council.
Baghdad radio claimed Iraq had come to the aid of ``revolutionary youth in Kuwait'' whom it said had toppled the Kuwaiti government.
Kuwaiti spokesman Nasser Al-Sabeeh said before the formal meeting that Kuwait wants negotiations with Iraq to be mediated by the Arab League.
The 15 members of the Security Council are China, Yemen, Romania, the Soviet Union, Cuba, Canada, Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Finland, France, the United States, the United Kingdom, Malaysia and Zaire.
