Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Monday the Irish Republican Army members who blew up the Royal Marines School of Music and killed 10 bandsmen last week are ``monsters'' who will be found and punished.
``The young men whom we lost were murdered by common murderers who must be found and brought to justice and put behind bars for a very long time,'' she said following a tour of the school's wrecked barracks in Deal, southeast England.
The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province with the Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.
``I hope we will have a part to play in finding them,'' said Kendall after opening the International Police Exhibition and Conference in London.
