Mount Pinatubo erupted with six thundering explosions today, shooting a giant plume of ash 15 miles high.
Molten rock and hot gas poured from the volcano, and nearby residents fled in panic.
A Filipino serving with the U.S. Navy became the first reported fatality related to the eruption when his car collided with a bus on an ash-slicked road north of the Subic Bay naval base.
Residents of nearby Angeles panicked when a huge, gray-greenish mushroom cloud burst from the volcano and turned day to night.
"This could be only the beginning," said Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology.
Angeles, a city of 300,000, is adjacent to Clark Air Base, but authorities had not ordered a general evacuation there.
They said most of the debris flowed into the Marella, Maraunot and O'Donnell rivers and that there had been no reports that property or homes had been damaged.
About 3,000 Aeta tribesman, descendants of the original inhabitants of the Philippines, fled the slopes of Mount Pinatubo.
At a refugee center in Olongapo, 35 miles southwest of the volcano, survivors told of the sky growing dark, then of hearing a tremendous explosion followed by a rain of ash.
They said they scampered for safety with their belongings and livestock over roads slippery with ashfall, many wearing cardboard boxes to protect themselves from the ash.
"Their faces turned ashen, and it looked like their hair was standing on end."
Ash was so thick in the air that at noon, motorists were driving with their headlights and windshield wipers on.
It was followed by a second explosion a few minutes later and a third, smaller blast at 11:49 a.m.
The cloud drifted westward into the South China Sea.
Two more thundering explosions rocked Mount Pinatubo late today.
