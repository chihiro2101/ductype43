There was plenty of blame to go around at the end of the lengthy and traumatic McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, but no one was willing to accept it.
In the nation's longest and costliest trial, Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted Thursday on 52 child molestation charges.
``Life is not fair,'' said Robert Curry, whose son attended the McMartin school.
Philibosian instead pointed the finger at the man who defeated him, current District Attorney Ira Reiner.
``Even if you accept that the children were molested, it didn't necessarily mean they were molested at the McMartin Pre-School,'' said juror Brenda Williams.
