The 29-storey Jijobhoy Towers, home of the Bombay Stock Exchange, was rocked by two powerful bombs last Friday, leaving 60 dead and 200 injured.
The market reopened on Monday in an attempt to return to normal.
It has had to compromise - trading has been restricted to an hour a day, and dealing has moved back to the traditional ring, where it stopped a year ago.
But another bomb blast in Calcutta triggered nervous selling yesterday, and the index came back by 50.62, or 2.1 per cent, to 2,409.23.
Dr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, disappointed traders in the budget at the end of last month.
To top it all, Dr Singh refused to equate domestic investors with their overseas counterparts in taxing short-term capital gains.
He lowered the tax to 30 per cent from 65 per cent for expatriate Indians and foreign investors but for local investors it remained at 44.5 per cent.
Overseas investors fuelled the downtrend as they sold some half a million shares of Reliance Industries, arbitraging between the share price on the Bombay stock exchange and the market price of its Euro-issue of global depository receipts (GDRs).
