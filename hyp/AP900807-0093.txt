An Iraqi airways jet carrying 78 foreigners and a number of Iraqi citizens arrived today, the first commercial flight allowed out of Iraq since it invaded Kuwait, a Japanese Embassy spokesman said.
The mostly Japanese tourists arrived at Amman airport at 6:15 p.m. (11:15 a.m. EDT) along with 34 members of an Iraqi football team, said the spokesman on condition of anonymity.
He said that the plane was due to leave Amman for an undisclosed destination.
The U.N. Security Council on Monday voted economic sanctions that ban all trade and military ties with Iraq.
Jordan's information minister, Ibrahim Izzedine, said earlier today that the U.S. government had asked Jordan to facilitate the entrance from Iraq of American diplomats and their dependents.
