Gilbert, an ``extremely dangerous hurricane'' and one of the strongest storms in history, roared toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula Tuesday with 175 mph winds after battering the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and the tiny Cayman Islands.
The hurricane killed at least five people Sunday in the Dominican Republic, civil defense officials said.
Six people died and 60,000 were left homeless in Jamaica on Monday, officials there said.
Prime Minister Edward Seaga said the hurricane swept the full length of Jamaica, ``leaving a trail of wreckage behind it.''
Communications were down with many storm-ravaged areas and the death toll was expected to rise with the arrival of damage and casualty reports.
The hurricane, traveling westward across the Caribbean Sea, was upgraded Tuesday to a Category 5, the strongest and deadliest type of hurricane.
Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., described Gilbert as ``a great hurricane ... in the top 10 percent (historically) as far as intensity, size and destructive potential.''
Mexican officials expected the storm to hit in the early morning hours Wednesday.
At midnight EDT the U.S. National Weather Service said Gilbert was centered near latitude 19.9 north, longitude 84.8 west, or about 150 miles east-southeast of Cozumel.
