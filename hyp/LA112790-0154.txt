John Major, who was endorsed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as her successor and heir, was elected today as leader of the Conservative Party and will become prime minister.
Major fell two votes short of the needed majority, but his opponents conceded defeat and Conservative Party officials declared him elected.
Major, 47, her chancellor of the Exchequer, is the youngest person to be elected Britain's prime minister since the 19th Century.
"It is a very exciting thing to become leader of the Conservative Party, and particularly exciting, I think, to follow one of the most remarkable leaders the Conservative Party has ever had," Major said.
We are going to unite totally and absolutely and we're going to win the next general election," said Major, who emerged smiling from his residence at 11 Downing St.
Major won 185 votes, former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine had 131 votes and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had 56 votes in a secret ballot election among Tory members of Parliament.
Thatcher left her residence at 10 Downing Street to congratulate Major, who as chancellor of the Exchequer is her next-door neighbor at No. 11.
