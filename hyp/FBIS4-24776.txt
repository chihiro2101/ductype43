[Editorial: "There Are Signs of Conservative Party Changing Its Leader"]
In local government elections across Britain yesterday, the Conservatives suffered their worst defeat ever, losing control of 17 regional councils and 444 seats.
As the ruling party, the Tories took just 27 percent of the vote, two percentage points lower than their rating in the polls.
The results of the local elections showed that the Tories were reduced to the third party nationally, behind the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Party.
The Labour Party controls 90 local councils, whereas the Conservatives only control 13, with a sharp contrast in strength between the two sides.
Of course, this was a measure taken by Tories under circumstances of an inevitable defeat to reduce losses by encouraging constituents, who resent the Tories, to vote for the Liberal Democrats rather than Labour.
But he who is in office must suffer the pain of electoral defeat.
After 9 June, John Major will have to answer for all of the disasters, and it is time to use him as a scapegoat.
For a very long period, right-wingers and left-wingers argued over many domestic and world issues.
John Major has always been weak and powerless, and vacillates to the left and to the right resulting in his own "crisis of honor.
" On the European issue, he stressed the imperative of maintaining the sovereignty, cultural traditions, and life-style of each country of the future European Union, while reflecting the islanders' mind set.
On the one hand, he expressed the will to join the European family; on the other, he made one big stride closer to the right.
While great skill is needed to have one's bread buttered on both sides, John Major has been relatively stupid in such circumstance.
