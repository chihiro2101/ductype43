Tank-led Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait before dawn Thursday, seizing the ruler's palace and other government buildings, Kuwaiti officials reported.,
The Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein said the Kuwaiti government had been overthrown.
The invasion comes nearly two weeks after Iraq massed troops on Kuwait's border in a dispute over an oilfield and Kuwait's violation of OPEC oil production quotas, which had kept down the price of crude.
``The Iraqis have occupied all of Kuwait!''
one Kuwaiti official shouted in a telephone interview.
``They have seized all administrative buildings, including the information ministry which houses the (state-run) radio and television stations,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The invaders, whose forces far outnumber those of smaller Kuwait, were led by the elite Republican Guard that did the brunt of the fighting in the 1980-88 war with Iran.
Residents in the palace's vicinity said it was seized after two hours of heavy artillery barrages.
The whereabouts of the emir, whose family has ruled the city-state for almost 250 years, was not immediately known.
Residents said there were about 50 tanks around the emir's palace and the neighboring U.S. Embassy.
The United States has extensive business ties to Kuwait, and the U.S. community in the nation _ slightly smaller than New Jersey _ is sizeable, in the thousands.
``We have conveyed this message to the Iraqi ambassador in Washington and to the Iraqi government through our embassy in Baghdad.
The Iraqi action was expected to dominate talks between President Bush and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher when they meet later Thursday in Aspen, Colo.
Iraqi officials on Wednesday had abruptly walked out on talks in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, complaining that the Kuwaiti representatives were not negotiating seriously.
``Iraq has responded to the request from interim government of free Kuwait and decided to cooperate with it,'' the Iraqi statement said.
