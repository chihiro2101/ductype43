Former Sen. John Tower of Texas and his daughter were among 23 people killed Friday when the twin-engine commuter plane they were aboard crashed while trying to land.
Astronaut Manley Lanier "Sonny" Carter Jr., who flew on a 1989 space shuttle mission and was in training for a shuttle trip later this year, also died in the crash.
Another victim was Dr. Nicholas Davies, president-elect of the American College of Physicians, a 60,000-member industry group, said Dr. Louis Felder, who worked with Davies at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta.
The crash followed by one day the plane-helicopter collision that killed Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania and six other people.
Tower, 65, and his daughter Marian, 35, boarded the 30-passenger, turboprop Embraer 120 in Atlanta and were headed to Sea Island, off the Georgia coast, for a party in Tower's honor.
The plane was descending in clear weather, authorities said, when it went down at 2:47 p.m. about three miles northeast of the runway at the Brunswick-Glynco Jetport.
There was no cropping of trees," said Lt. Jack Hopper of the Glynn County Police Department, quoting witnesses.
Atlantic Southeast's senior vice president, John Beiser, said officials had no indication from the pilot that the flight was in trouble.
