The Hubble Space Telescope orbited with its big eye open Friday after ground controllers overcame communications problems and lifted its lens cover, but its electronics were shut down due to a malfunction.
Those problems, however, were not the immediate concern of shuttle Discovery's astronauts, who prepared for Sunday's return to Earth.
It's on its own,'' Mission Control's Story Musgrave told the five crew members.
``That's great news,'' replied Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver.
Discovery is to land at 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
Landing would have been delayed a day if astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan had had to perform a space walk to crank open the telescope's lens cover, or aperture door.
One of the two antennas apparently had swung too far, and the telescope shut down, said Jean Oliver, a Hubble deputy project manager.
If future movements of the antenna have to be limited to avoid the problem, it would have only slight impact on the telescope's observing time, Oliver said.
When the door opened, two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working; later, engineers got them back on line.
The motion of the lens cover knocked out the gyros, said Dave Drachlis of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.
It will take another day to get the instrument operating normally again, putting controllers at Goddard several days behind.
``We're trying to be very deliberate and trying not to cut any corners and do anything fast because we feel there's a lot at risk here and we want to make sure we're doing it properly,'' Oliver said.
``We've got a long future ahead of us, and we want to make sure it starts off on the right foot.''
Tolerances for the telescope systems were set particularly narrow for the first operations and that was the cause of many malfunctions, Terry said.
