On the spot where Lenin once spoke, the focus Tuesday was on Lennon.
Official newspapers, which once denounced the Beatles as harmful pests from the decadent West, joined a worldwide celebration and ran stories of tribute about the late John Lennon, who would have turned 50 on Tuesday.
Two concerts devoted to the songwriter, guitarist and singer, who was shot to death in 1980, were held in Moscow.
An anchorman, more accustomed to reading official government news, reported on the worldwide Lennon birthday bash and called his song ``Imagine,'' an ``anthem of peace.''
About 1,000 Soviets, mostly second generation Beatles fans, flocked to the Moscow Electrical Lamp Factory's cultural hall in northeastern part of the city to rejoice in Lennon's music.
``He's like a hero, a symbol for every person: a symbol of honesty, talent, devotion to his ideals, notion of love, equality between people and goodness,'' said Irina Dykomkina, the 21-year-old secretary of the Sgt.
Andrei Trushkin, a correspondent for Komsomolskaya Pravda - the Communist Party youth newspaper that devoted a full page Tuesday to Lennon - said he appeals to Soviet youth in part because he was a rebel, like many of them, and was a ``difficult teen-ager.''
