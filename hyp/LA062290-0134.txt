Iranian news media reacted with little emotion Thursday to a killer earthquake that left an estimated 25,000 people dead in northern Iran.
The country has endured several massive tragedies in recent years.
An estimated 1 million Iranians were killed or wounded in the eight-year war with Iraq that ended in 1988.
Roughly the same number died in a December, 1988, quake in nearby Soviet Armenia.
Within half an hour, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported that the tremor had been felt in Tehran, the capital.
The only detail reported for hours was that, when the quake hit, Tehran residents were either asleep or watching a World Cup soccer match between Brazil and Scotland.
