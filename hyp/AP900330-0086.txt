A leader of the Moslem separatist movement in Kashmir tried to hurl a grenade into a police bunker Friday but was killed in a volley of police gunfire.
Tens of thousands of Moslems gathered later for the funeral.
Comrades fired into the air and vowed to carry on the fight for independence from India.
Ashfaq Majid Wani, 28, was a leader of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, a leading separatist group.
Police said he tried to throw the grenade at a police bunker in downtown Srinagar while riding by on a motor scooter.
Hours later, thousands of residents gathered near Wani's house in an attempt to hold a funeral procession in defiance of a government curfew.
Women wailed and beat their chest as Wani's body was taken out of the ambulance and placed near the grave.
The two countries then were one year old, having been partitioned from the British colonial India.
