Dawn broke Sunday over a battle-scarred Tiananmen Square with tanks and rifle-toting troops ruling the vast expanse occupied the day before by students seeking a freer society from their communist rulers.
A low cloud of smoke covered much of the 100-acre square as bonfires set during the night's confrontation continued to smolder.
Hundreds of helmeted troops were deployed on the monument to revolutionary heroes in the square's center and thousands more at important intersections nearby.
Gunfire could be heard from several sides, and tracers zipped through the sky above Mao Tse-tung's mausoleum, one of the main monuments to Chinese communism in the square.
Torched buses and army vehicles on the streets around Tiananmen billowed acrid smoke.
Troops first entered the square from the south, when a column trotted toward the student encampment about 1 a.m. (noon EDT Saturday).
More soldiers were deployed in front of the Great Hall of the People to the west, and a huge convoy with armored vehicles rolled down Changan Avenue to the north side.
