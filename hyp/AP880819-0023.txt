Dan Quayle's vice presidential nomination was supposed to be a triumph for the precocious young Indiana senator, but the dream faded overnight.
Bush's surprise choice for his running mate was supposed to ignite a campaign that has seemed at times to suffer from lack of inspiration, but he quickly encountered questions over his military record and suggestions he could best serve the Republicans by withdrawing from the ticket.
Though he found himself in danger of fizzling Thursday, Quayle managed to stir the convention hall with his upbeat speech about family, generations and the rosy future he foresaw under a Bush administration.
The 41-year-old nominee delivered the speech with calm self-assurance, sticking close to his text and avoiding his penchant for extemporaneous remarks _ perhaps another result of the unanticipated controversy.
Bush, who followed his running mate to the podium, said he was ``proud to have Dan Quayle at my side.''
Gen. Wendell C. Phillippi _ who worked for Quayle's grandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam, as managing editor of The Indianapolis News
_ said he contacted the National Guard on behalf of Quayle when the young man applied in 1969 and ``recommended him very highly,'' the News reported.
A Bush aide said the matter was discussed with the Indiana senator during the process that led to his selection for the Bush ticket, and Quayle had denied that he used influence to gain admittance to the Guard.
