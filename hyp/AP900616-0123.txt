The mother of a 12-year-old girl swept away by a flash flood was clinging to hope that her daughter was alive but perhaps unable to get home, a family friend said Saturday.
Janice Trigg's daughter, Kerri, was among nearly three dozen still missing Saturday night, two days after the floods hit eastern Ohio.
``She keeps saying Kerri Jo may have amnesia, or she can't move to get help.
Searchers for the missing used trained dogs to sniff through the rubble and along the banks of the Wegee and Pipe creeks, which empty into the Ohio River, in an effort that stretched five miles south of this town.
The friend, 9-year-old Amber Colvin, was swept down Wegee Creek and into the Ohio River, but survived a seven-mile ordeal by clinging to logs.
Deanna Hulderman, 48, said she and her husband, Clancey, were pulled under by Wegee Creek flood water at a bar but were reunited about a half-hour later.
