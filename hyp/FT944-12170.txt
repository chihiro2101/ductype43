'WAL-MART: A HISTORY OF SAM WALTON'S RETAIL PHENOMENON' by Sandra S. Vance and Roy V. Scott Twayne Publishers, New York, Dollars 14.95
240 pages Many people might be said to be the personification of the American Dream
Walton is a character it would be difficult to invent, an all-American boy who became one of the world's most successful businessmen.
His company, Wal-Mart, made sales of Dollars 55bn last year, and after Walton's death Fortune magazine reported that his wife and four children held between them the second-largest fortune in the world - Dollars 23.5bn.
Although Walton built up a small chain of Ben Franklin variety store franchises from 1945, it was not until 1962 that he opened his first Wal-Mart discount store.
At the time of its incorporation in 1971, Wal-Mart had only 38 outlets with sales of Dollars 44m - not enough to earn a place in trade journal Discount Merchandiser's list of the 71 biggest US discount retailers.
Rather, he realised the threat discounting posed to his own variety store business and studied in depth many of the US's leading discounters of the early 1960s, including Ann and Hope, E J Korvette, Spartan's, Fed-Mart, and K mart.
As early as the 1950s, Walton realised he was wasting too much time travelling and bought a small aircraft to pilot between stores himself - something he continued to do to the end of his life.
But perhaps the most fundamental reason for its success, the book suggests, has been Wal-Mart's streamlined and highly responsive management structure.
They discuss results, problems and suggestions from the week at a 7.30am meeting on Saturdays and immediately afterwards call district managers to relate the results.
