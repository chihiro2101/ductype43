Iran said today that it would welcome relief offered by its bitter enemy, the United States, to help victims of the earthquake that has killed as many as 35,000 people, the State Department said in Washington.
The aid would be accepted through the American Red Cross and other U.S. humanitarian organizations, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said.
"We want to be helpful without regard for our political differences with Iran," he said.
There have been only rare instances of U.S.-Iranian cooperation since the two countries broke diplomatic relations a decade ago.
Boucher said Iran told the U.S. government that private donor agencies should contact the Iranian Red Crescent, a humanitarian group that is the conduit for all outside assistance.
Boucher said the Iranian message to the United States presumably was delivered through a third party but added that he was uncertain.
Iran reportedly said it would accept aid from all countries -- including Iraq -- but excluded Israel and South Africa.
The Islamic Republic News Agency said 6,000 people were pulled from rubble and airlifted from the stricken Gilan and Zanjan provinces to hospitals.
