The death toll from last week's flash floods mounted to 21 today when a body was found in the Ohio River, and authorities said there was little hope for the 14 people still listed as missing.
You can't swim out there that long in the Ohio River,'' said Chuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator.
Heavy rain fell for about 45 minutes, swelling Wegee Creek, one of two creeks that overflowed in Thursday night's flash flood.
Lt. Dean Irvin of the Ohio Army National Guard said there were no immediate reports of additional property damage.
The body found this morning was in the Ohio River near Moundsville, W.Va., about 10 miles south of Shadyside, according to Chuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator.
The number of names on the list of missing dropped from 18 to 14 with the identities of three victims and a call by one person alerting authorities that she was safe, Vogt said.
The floods destroyed as many as 70 houses and damaged up to 40 others.
That creek never flooded.
The debris broke loose, and that's when we got three big gushes of water,''
``They told us homeowners' won't do us no good.
