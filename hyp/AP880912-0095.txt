Hurricane Gilbert, packing 110 mph winds and torrential rain, moved over this capital city today after skirting Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
``Right now it's actually moving over Jamaica,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
``It looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across that island, and they're going to bear the full brunt of this powerful hurricane,'' Sheets said.
Forecasters say Gilbert was expected to lash Jamaica throughout the day and was on track to later strike the Cayman Islands, a small British dependency northwest of Jamaica.
All Jamaica-bound flights were canceled at Miami International Airport, while flights from Grand Cayman, the main island of the three-island chain, arrived packed with frightened travelers.
``People were running around in the main lobby of our hotel (on Grand Cayman) like chickens with their heads cut off,'' said one vacationer who was returning home to California through Miami.
The Associated Press' Caribbean headquarters in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was unable to get phone calls through to Kingston, where high winds and heavy rain preceding the storm drenched the capital overnight, toppling trees, causing local flooding and littering streets with branches.
Prime Minister Edward Seaga of Jamaica alerted all government agencies, saying Sunday night: ``Hurricane Gilbert appears to be a real threat and everyone should follow the instructions and hurricane precautions issued by the Office of Disaster Preparedness in order to minimize the danger.''
Cuba's official Prensa Latina news agency said a state of alert was declared at midday in the Cuban provinces of Guantanamo, Holguin, Santiago de Cuba and Granma.
