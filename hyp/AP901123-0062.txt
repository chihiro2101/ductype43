Former President Reagan thanked British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for backing him up when other allies backed down, heaping praise on his political soulmate as she heads off into the sunset.
``Margaret Thatcher was a completely reliable ally and partner of the greatest personal integrity,'' Reagan said in a statement after Mrs. Thatcher announced her impending retirement.
Mrs. Thatcher on Thursday succumbed to the challenge mounted by Michael Heseltine, who resigned as her defense minister in 1986.
Two years ago, as they met for the final time before Reagan left office, the president said he was leaving the White House with ``considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that Margaret Thatcher will still reside at No. 10 Downing Street.''
She also encouraged Reagan's nurturing of the huge Pentagon buildup, and backed U.S. efforts to install medium-range missiles in Europe, despite opposition from NATO allies.
Both leaders adopted a hard line toward the Soviet Union, but were quick to warm up to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as the Cold War thawed.
