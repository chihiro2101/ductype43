New treatments that stop a heart attack in its tracks may help victims to get out of the hospital more quickly than ever before, perhaps even three days after their attacks, a study published today concludes.
Doctors from the University of Michigan Medical Center studied the effects of sending a few carefully selected heart patients home early.
They found that these people had no unusual complications, got back to work sooner and had substantially lower medical bills.
``It was an extraordinarily safe strategy,'' said Dr. Eric J. Topol, the study's director.
Topol said the early discharges were made possible by two recent medical advances _ tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, and angioplasty.
However, the study in the New England Journal of Medicine said more research is needed before the findings are widely adopted.
When President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered an uncomplicated heart attack in 1955, he spent seven weeks recovering in the hospital.
