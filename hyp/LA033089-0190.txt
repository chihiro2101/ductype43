Well, it did turn out to be "Rain Man's" evening, but not until the last few minutes, and if there was a message in Wednesday night's Academy Awards results, it's that parity has returned to Hollywood.
For two-thirds of the show, the academy voters seemed determined to give an award to every film nominated.
Rain Man" did win the grand prize (and three other big ones) and "Mississippi Burning," with just one Oscar for cinematography, did get punished for its highly publicized historical muddling.
But gone, for a refreshing change, was the slate voting that has turned many recent Academy Awards shows into one-note evenings that kept some deserving people out of the Oscar resale market.
The final score shows "Rain Man" with four Oscars and "Dangerous Liaisons" and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" with three each.
David Grusin's Oscar for scoring "The Milagro Beanfield War" overcame even bigger odds, winning over popular John Williams' score for "The Accidental Tourist."
