Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday proposed tougher legislation to punish Soviets who seek to kindle ethnic unrest, saying ``nationalist passions'' benefit opponents of his reforms.
The Soviet leader told a meeting of the Communist Party leadership that inter-ethnic relations were worsening in some regions of the country, due in part to ``active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt groups.''
State-run media also indicated Friday that a crackdown had begun on people in Armenia who continue to agitate for annexation of a mostly Armenian enclave in the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan.
The six-month conflict between the two republics over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh district has led to mass rallies, strikes and ethnic violence since February.
The Supreme Soviet Presidium, the government's top executive body, intervened July 18.
The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh is one of the most rancorous domestic disputes faced by Gorbachev since he became Communist Party chief in March 1985.
