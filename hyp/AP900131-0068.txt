West German officials and media today praised Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for softening his view on German reunification and said it could give hope to disheartened East Germans.
Disgraced former Communist Party leader Erich Honecker was released from prison Tuesday night after justice officials determined he was too frail to withstand the rigors of imprisonment while awaiting trial on treason charges.
Gorbachev said Tuesday in Moscow that he believed one Germany was likely in the future, but he added that Germans ``should not decide this important question on the streets.''
He referred to the growing number of demonstrations in East Germany in support of reunification.
In West Germany, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher told West German Radio that Gorbachev had ``correctly analyzed'' the situation and again shown his political skill.
In an interview with the West German Bild newspaper, party leader Gregor Gysi complained that the reunification drive is moving too quickly.
The man most blamed for the country's problems, Honecker, was set free after an East Berlin court rejected a request that he be kept in prison until his trial in March.
He was expelled from the Communist Party in December and has since been accused of treason and abusing his power.
