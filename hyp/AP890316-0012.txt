John G. Tower has fallen, but the sky has not.
For all the forecasts of dire results if the Senate blocked Tower's path to the Pentagon, business is proceeding as usual.
President Bush said the case was closed and accepted Democratic assurances of future cooperation.
That doesn't undo the resentment among some of Tower's more ardent Republican allies in the Senate and in some corners of the White House.
Bush lieutenants claimed they had heard what sounded like assurances of support from a dozen Senate Democrats.
Nevertheless, a week after the former Texas senator was denied confirmation as secretary of defens, the waters have closed.
``We've established what will be known as the Tower standards,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va.
But it will be a debating point, not a turning point, in a Wright controversy that was ordained long before the Tower episode.
Indeed, it could turn out that the Senate did the president a favor by sending Tower back to Texas instead of to the Pentagon.
And the Reagan White House went to some lengths to rule the senator out of the job he sought, declaring that the new president would not be nominating any Senate Republican for any Cabinet post.
Bush said he had been fighting for the right of a president to appoint his own Cabinet, but he avoided language that would have raised the political stakes.
But Bush said all along that the outcome, either way, would not hurt on other issues.
