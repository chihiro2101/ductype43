Tens of thousands of people chanting ``Freedom! Freedom!''
trekked to a Moslem saint's shrine Saturday to campaign for the secession of Kashmir from India, witnesses and pro-separatist activists said.
At least three people died in two separate incidents on Saturday in Kashmir, the center of the four-decade-old separatist campaign, witnesses said.
Meanwhile, the president of the Pakistan state of Kashmir said in an interview Saturday that Kashmiris there had begun smuggling arms across the border to Moslem insurgents fighting for independence from India.
President Abdul Qayyum, speaking to a reporter who traveled to Pakistan's Kashmir, said the people of his state also had been sheltering insurgents since India launched the military crackdown in its state of Jammu-Kashmir last month.
Vehicles stopped 10 miles from the shrine as people thronged the roads, said witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
On Friday, at least 200,000 people marched to the office of the United Nations Military Observers Group in Srinagar, demanding a plebiscite in Kashmir, police said.
