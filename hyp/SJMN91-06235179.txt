A week before the Soviet coup, U.S. intelligence officials warned the White House of "a real possibility" that hard-liners in the KGB or the Soviet military might act to block the scheduled signing of the new Union Treaty, senior government officials said Wednesday, but they acknowledged they knew too little about such plans to enable President Bush to act.
The treaty, which reduces Moscow's centralized control and strengthens powers of the Soviet Union's 15 republics, is anathema to Soviet conservatives.
As soon as the hard-liners made their move Sunday night -- two days before Gorbachev was to sign the treaty -- it was obvious the coup was doomed to failure, they said.
One result of the bungled coup is that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev -- even though reinstated as head of state -- "could be irrelevant" to what happens next, analysts said.
