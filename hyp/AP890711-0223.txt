He's ranked as the richest man in the nation by a leading business magazine, but to folks in Bentonville, a town of about 8,700 people, Sam Walton is just another neighbor.
``He's just a part of the community,'' said Curt Loyd, executive director of the Bentonville Chamber of Commerce.
Walton, who prefers bird-hunting, tennis and opening new Wal-Mart stores to trumpeting his personal financial holdings, is again shunning publicity about his third consecutive ranking among the world's top billionaires.
According to Forbes magazine's July 24 edition, the Walton family's estimated worth is $8.7 billion, up from its 1988 estimate of $6.5 billion.
``He is unavailable,'' said Wal-Mart spokesman Don Shinkle of the silver-haired founder of the nation's third-largest retail chain, based in Bentonville, about 150 miles northwest of Little Rock.
Shinkle said he received about 10 calls from reporters Monday morning, when the Forbes list appeared in newspapers.
Shinkle said news coverage about Walton ``usually sets off a press frenzy'' for comments from him.
Just after the 1987 stock market crash, in which Walton's family-owned chunk of Wal-Mart stock lost millions in value, he quipped in response to questions at a news conference on another topic that it was only paper.
Walton made that listing as the richest American every year since.
