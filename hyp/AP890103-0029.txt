Authorities charged a 22-year-old ferry captain with negligent homicide after the boat, overcrowded with New Year's travelers, sank off the Caribbean coast.
Officials said 46 people survived the sinking of the ferry Justo Rufino Barrios II in Amatique Bay on Guatemala's east coast Sunday.
Juan Pablo Ezquibel was arrested after authorities determined that about 120 people were aboard the 30-ton ferry, which was authorized to carry 90, said Capt. Anibal Giron Arreola, second-in-command at the Puerto Barrios naval base.
Esquibel radioed that he had taken the wheel just as the boat began to capsize, Giron Arreola said.
The Rufino Barrios Maritime Transport firm owns the ferry and operates two other ferries along the Livingston-Puerto Barrios route.
