A passenger ferry sank off the Caribbean coast while being towed to port, and 59 people drowned and six are missing, authorities and news reports said today.
Capt. Anibal Giron Arreola, a spokesman at the Puerto Barrios naval base, said the ferry Justo Rufino Barrios II sank Sunday afternoon in Amatique Bay.
He said by telephone that 59 people died.
Juan Jose Gaytan, a reporter at Radio Portena in Puerto Barrios, said the Justo Rufineo Barrios II ran out of fuel midway on a regular 16-mile run from the town Livingston, across the bay, to Puerto Barrios.
