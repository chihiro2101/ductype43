Sports Illustrated is taking 300 advertisers to Super Bowl XXI in Pasadena, Calif., this weekend for an all-out bash.
Along with getting seats for Sunday's game, the guests will brunch at the chic Spago restaurant, take a private tour of Universal Studios and attend a wing-ding at the Century Plaza Hotel.
The magazine is just one of hundreds of businesses whose officials and customers will be among the 104,000 fans attending the Super Bowl.
And the companies show few signs of cutting back on their activities despite the new tax law's tighter restrictions on what can be claimed as a business-entertainment expense.
Still, the new rules do change things for a variety of Super Bowl entertaining -- from an executive sitting in a $1,500 seat on the 50-yard line to a businessman holding a Super Bowl party in his living room and hoping to write off the costs.
One big change under the new law limits business-entertainment deductions for tickets to sporting events like the Super Bowl: Only 80% of the face value of such tickets can be deducted.
Air fare and lodging are still 100% deductible, as long as there is a planned business meeting in addition to the game.
He also advises party hosts to keep a guest list and note their business connection.
That will be a big job for Barron Hilton, chairman of Hilton Hotels Corp., who along with Alex Spanos, owner of the San Diego Chargers, is holding a pre-Super Bowl brunch Sunday at the Beverly Hilton Hotel for 1,800 guests including business leaders, entertainment personalities and customers.
Allen Hermansen, a Hilton senior vice president, says the bash is tax deductible because "our sales people will be there and business will be discussed."
