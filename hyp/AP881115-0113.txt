The expensive practice of using balloon catheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heart attacks, now routinely done at many large hospitals, is unnecessary and should be abandoned, according to a major study released Tuesday.
The study found that if heart attack victims quickly receive clot-dissolving drugs, they usually don't need the extra step of the common balloon procedure, known as angioplasty.
Some experts said the results are good news, because they mean that most heart attack patients can be treated in community hospitals, where angioplasty is not available.
``This trial has settled one of the most important questions in modern-day cardiology,'' commented Dr. J. Ward Kennedy of the University of Washington, Seattle.
The study is phase 2 of the Thrombolysis in Miocardial Infarction Trial, or TIMI-II, directed by Dr. Eugene Braunwald of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
The first phase of the study showed that giving people a clot-dissolving drug called tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, immediately after heart attacks dramatically improved their chances of survival.
Dr. Thomas J. Ryan of Boston University Medical Center commented, ``We have the answer in this trial to a very important question of health care delivery.''
The purpose of TPA and similar drugs is to dissolve these clots before the muscle dies.
Many people delay going to the hospital until permanent damage occurs.
