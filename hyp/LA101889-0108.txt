There are events one never forgets.
Anyone who was alive in 1963 remembers where he was when President Kennedy was assassinated.
And anyone who was at Candlestick Park Tuesday night for Game 3 of the World Series will never forget.
To me, the earthquake was not as bad as the Whittier quake in October, 1987, mainly because I was awake this time.
It was opening and closing as if the place was made of cardboard instead of concrete.
