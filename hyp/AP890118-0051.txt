Children whose families escaped the horrors of the Vietnam War saw their schoolyard turned into a killing field, the target of a silent gunman armed with a rifle and a pistol bearing the word ``victory.''
After the massacre at recess, the bodies of three Southeast Asian children were outlined in blue on the playground of Cleveland Elementary School where they died.
Two others had been dragged by teachers inside to a classroom, but also died.
Binh said she was sitting in math class when the shooting began outside the wood-and-stucco school building.
The gunfire startled Michael Cuevas, whose first thought was that the University of the Pacific fraternities near his house were firing their miniature cannon again.
``I never thought a tragedy of this magnitude could happen in Stockton,'' said Cuevas, a 29-year-old marine clerk at the Port of Stockton who lives down the street from the elementary school.
Police cars and news reporters crowded the street, which typically is busy only when parents pick up and drop off their children.
The 40-year-old neighborhood near the University of the Pacific is still home to many retired couples who raised their familes there.
About 60 percent of Cleveland Elementary's students are of Southeast Asian descent, said John Klose, spokesman for the Stockton School District.
``When the car exploded, my grandpa's house just shook,'' Abbott said.
