Florence Griffith Joyner twice smashed a world record Thursday as she blazed to a gold medal in the 200-meter sprint.
She also stayed on target to become the second woman to win four track and field gold medals in a single Olympics.
In that race, she ran 21.56, eclipsing the 9-year-old mark of 21.71 set in 1979 by Marita Koch of East Germany and equaled three times since.
Noted for her long, painted fingernails and racy, colorful bodysuits, Griffith Joyner of Los Angeles has a chance to match the 1984 quadruple gold medal performance of U.S. sprinter and long jumper Carl Lewis, and by Fanny Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands in 1948.
