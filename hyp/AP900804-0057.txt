Saudi Arabia, an oil-rich ally of Kuwait, has been subdued in its reaction to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
The only direct Saudi statement since the invasion was made by an anonymous government spokesman through the official Saudi Press Agency the day after the Iraqi move.
The only tangible help Saudi Arabia gave the Kuwait government was to shelter members of the ruling family, including the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and his crown prince.
The Saudis also allowed them briefly to operate a radio, reportedly from a mobile van in the area around the Saudi-Kuwait border.
It was not known if the radio had been discovered by the Iraqis or shut down by the Saudis to avoid provoking Iraqi President Saddam Hussein at a time when fears were being expressed that he might invade Saudi Arabia as well.
Oil executives said Saudi Arabia has not and will not take the most potent action possible against Iraq _ closing the pipeline that carries Iraqi oil for export across Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea.
The Saudis did condemn the invasion as part of a joint statement issued by the Gulf Cooperation Council, in which it is allied for economic and security cooperation with Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain.
