In the first eruption of controversy at a confirmation hearing for a Bush Administration Cabinet nominee, a prominent conservative told a Senate panel Tuesday that John Tower may lack the "moral character" to be secretary of defense.
"Over the course of many years, I have encountered the nominee in a condition -- lack of sobriety -- as well as with women to whom he was not married," conservative activist Paul M. Weyrich told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Criticism from Weyrich and other witnesses prompted some committee members to temper the panel's earlier praise for the former Texas senator.
But several members conceded that, while their former colleague may not be the ideal candidate for the Pentagon's top job, he probably will win Senate approval anyway.
Weyrich, president of the conservative Free Congress Foundation, testified that Tower's behavior makes him unfit to lead the Pentagon into an era of belt-tightening and management reform.
In an extraordinary challenge to Tower's nomination, Weyrich also suggested that Tower's moral shortcomings could make him vulnerable to attempts by foreign governments "to bring pressure on the United States government and on him personally.
Tower, 63 and twice-divorced, served 24 years in the Senate from Texas, including a tenure as chairman of the Armed Services Committee from 1981 to 1984.
In announcing Tower as his choice for the post on Dec. 16, President Bush called the talk "a lot of rumors that proved to be groundless."
Fulbright Institute scholar William C. Jackson Jr. and William G. Phillips, president of the Washington-based National Council for Industrial Defense, joined Weyrich Tuesday in opposing Tower's nomination.
