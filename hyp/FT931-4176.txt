A ROW has erupted between the Bombay stock exchange, India's largest stock market, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the securities watchdog, over the board's recent first-ever inspection of stockbrokers' books.
The Sebi has accused stockbrokers of flouting the exchange's rules, including regulations on margin trading designed to limit the risk of members defaulting through excessive speculative investments.
The argument will do nothing to restore investors' faith in the stock market where, as measured by the Bombay stock exchange's 30-share index, shares have fallen 48 per cent from their peak early last year, including a 320 points fall since the government's budget was announced two weeks ago.
In one of its most damaging passages, the inspectors' report alleges that D S Prabhoodas, a leading firm headed by Mr Hemendra Kothari, a former BSE president, and by Mr Jaswant Chotalal, a member of the BSE's governing body, avoided margin payments totalling Rs185.4m (Pounds 4.08m).
Mr M R Mayya, the BSE's executive director, said BSE rules permitted such bilateral off-exchange transactions.
