Moldavia, acting to defuse one of the Soviet Union's most explosive ethnic conflicts, agreed Sunday to comply with a Kremlin order to reconsider its law making Moldavian the republic's official language.
The republic's parliament acted in response to a decree issued on Dec. 22 by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the official news agency Tass reported.
Tass said the Moldavan parliament agreed to disband the nationalguard and to revise a law that Gorbachev said restricted the rights of minorities.
Ethnic tension has gripped Moldavia, a largely agricultural republic bordering Romania, during its push for independence from the Soviet Union this year.
The unrest turned violent last month, when government troops clashed with activists, leaving four dead.
Gorbachev said the conflicts had reached ``critical levels,'' and he put part of the blame on the Moldavian Supreme Soviet for enacting laws that discriminate against minorities.
