Jurors who have reached verdicts on 52 counts in the McMartin preschool molestation case said Wednesday they are deadlocked on the remaining 13 charges in the nation's longest, costliest criminal trial.
Superior Court Judge William Pounders received a note from the jurors as they ended their day's deliberation and called a hearing for Thursday to discuss the deadlock and possibly opening the 52 sealed verdicts.
In an interview Wednesday evening, Pounders said he would deal with the deadlocked counts first, either declaring a mistrial on those counts and reading the sealed verdicts, or sending the jury back to resume deliberations on the undecided counts.
He said the verdicts could also be read before sending the jury back.
The jurors are deciding whether Raymond Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, are guilty or innocent of charges they molested children at their family-owned McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach.
Jurors asked twice for an explanation of how they could convict one defendant and acquit the other on that joint charge, but seemed perplexed after they received an explanation earlier Wednesday.
After conferring with lawyers, Pounders told jurors they could convict just one of the defendants on the charge ``if you feel that the defendant conspired with one or more other persons.''
