The two dominant home and automobile insurers in the Carolinas said Tuesday that they expect to be hit with about $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo.
State Farm Insurance Co. expects claims as high as $400 million in South Carolina, where it insures one out of every five homes, spokesman Jerry Parsons said.
The Bloomington, Ill.-based company is also projecting an additional $100 million in claims from storm damage in North Carolina and Virginia, he said.
Additionally, Nationwide Insurance Co. said it expects claims close to $100 million, more than triple the $31 million that the company paid for damages caused by Hurricane Elena when it swept through Florida, Alabama and Mississippi in 1985.
"Our previous all-time high was in 1983, when we paid $165 million in comparable claims for Hurricane Alicia, which struck Galveston and Houston.
Nationwide, based in Columbus, Ohio, is the biggest home and auto insurance in North Carolina, where damage was unexpectedly high, and is the third-largest insurer in South Carolina.
The New York-based company had substantial business in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, where Hugo first struck with devastating force.
The charge might push Continental into the red for the quarter, said Udayan Ghose, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York.
