As protests gathered strength last fall, East Germany's longtime orthodox leader Erich Honecker ``lost touch with reality,'' according to the man who succeeded him as Communist leader only to be ousted later.
Egon Krenz, the successor, and former Politburo member Guenter Schabowski on Wednesday gave their versions of the bunker mentality that engulfed the hard-liners toward the end.
``There was the notion in the former party leadership that everything outside of planned events and demonstrations staged by the Communist youth group was an action organized by enemy forces,'' Krenz told an investigating commission in East Berlin.
Schabowski said Honecker had personally ordered police attacks against demonstrators in early October, working closely with his then-secret police chief, Erich Mielke.
The attempts at suppression were engineered by Honecker and Mielke, bypassing the other 19 members of the ruling Politburo, Krenz insisted.
``Then-general secretary Erich Honecker and the internal security chief Erich Mielke immediately after each session of the Politburo consulted with each other on the security situation of the German Democratic Republic,'' Krenz said.
Krenz added that he and other then-members of the Politburo failed to realize that the Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches were ``not working against but rather for the German Democratic Republic.''
