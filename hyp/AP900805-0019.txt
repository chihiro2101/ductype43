The radio of Kuwait's new Iraqi-installed government claimed that Iraqi troops began pulling out of Kuwait on Sunday, but the United States said it doubted a withdrawal was really under way.
The radio announcement came three days after Iraq invaded Kuwait and one day after Baghdad said it had replaced the oil-rich kingdom's ousted monarchy with a new government made up of nine Kuwaiti army offices.
Iraq also said Saturday that it was creating a new Kuwaiti army and that 100,000 Iraqis, the approximate number of soldiers Baghdad took over Kuwait with, had volunteered for the new military force.
_The White House continued to seek the immediate and unconditional withdrawl of all Iraqi troops, and it thanked the many nations who have condemned the invasion and imposed economic sanctions on Baghdad.
Japan, which imports 99 percent of its oil, had relied on Iraq and Kuwait for more than 11 percent of its oil imports.
The White House hailed Japan's move and said Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu called President Bush on Sunday at Camp David to inform him about the sanctions.
An unconfirmed report said a warplane from the deposed emir's air force in Kuwait bombed an Iraqi military headquarters near Kuwait city.
The other eight members were lieutenant colonels and majors.
President Bush said Friday that if Iraq moved against Saudi Arabia it would be attacking U.S. ``vital interests.''
