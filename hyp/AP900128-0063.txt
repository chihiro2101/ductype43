The San Francisco 49ers routed the Denver Broncos 55-10 Sunday in the most lopsided Super Bowl victory ever.
The 49ers' win in the 24th Super Bowl made them the first repeat NFL champion in a decade and tied the Pittsburgh Steelers as a pinnacle of Super Bowl perfection with four wins in four tries.
San Francisco won the National Football League championship game in 1989, 1985 and 1982.
For Denver quarterback John Elway, it was a day of futility, ending with his third Super Bowl defeat.
