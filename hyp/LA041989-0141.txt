A fiery explosion in a giant gun turret rocked the refitted battleship Iowa on maneuvers in the Atlantic today, killing at least 47 sailors and injuring an undetermined number, the Pentagon said.
Defense Department spokesman Dan Howard said the explosion may have resulted from the blast of a 110-pound gunpowder bag used to fire shells that weigh more than a ton a distance of up to 23 miles.
The 16-inch guns are the biggest in the Navy arsenal.
"We assume it was a powder bag," Howard said in Brussels.
The Iowa headed toward Roosevelt Roads Naval Base in Puerto Rico.
"We lost fine young lives," President Bush said during a photo session with congressional leaders at the White House.

The guns are originals dating from the ship's first commissioning at the height of World War II in 1943 as a sister ship of the Missouri, aboard which the Japanese signed the war-ending surrender document.
The ship was deployed in the Persian Gulf region between September, 1987, and February, 1988, as a symbol of America's ability to strike deep into Iran.
