The engineer of a ferry that sank off this Red Sea port, leaving more than 400 people missing, today denied accusations of widespread negligence on the part of the ship's crew.
Mahmoud Moharram, engineer of the Salem Express, acknowledged misconduct by some crew members but said the survival of only about 10 of the 71-member crew indicated negligence was not widespread.
Investigators were looking into complaints from some survivors that the crew abandoned the ferry without helping passengers and that some crew members pushed aside passengers to get to lifeboats.
Moharram said he helped 17 passengers put on life jackets.
He said the ferry sank quickly Saturday night after being tossed into a coral reef by stormy seas.
Only seven bodies have been recovered since the ferry went down, leaving 462 people missing.
"The crew told us to stand on one side.
Egypt's director of port security, Hassan al-Aghouri, said the rescue was delayed by the storm.
Lt. Gen. Salah Halaby, chief of staff of Egypt's armed forces, said 30 Egyptian navy divers were searching for victims or, less likely, survivors.
