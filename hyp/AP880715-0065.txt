Public interest in the Earth's troubled climate may be washed away with the heavy rains that are needed to end the current U.S. drought, weather experts warned during a drought symposium here.
``Society tends to flit from hysteria to hysteria,'' said Pat Michaels, Virginia's state climatologist and moderator of the symposium.
He said the 1988 drought, although not as dry as a 1986 drought in many places, has drawn much attention because some of the affected areas include large media centers.
``I'm worried ... that when the next drought happens, we are going to have to rediscover the climate problem,'' said Michaels, president of the Association of State Climatologists.
However, Alan Hecht, director of the National Climate Program in Washington, D.C., said the uncertainty means policymakers should begin to deal with the possible effects, especially undertaking policies that ``make sense in their own right.''
