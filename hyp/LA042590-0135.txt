The space shuttle Discovery brought a thundering end to years of frustration when it blasted off Tuesday to extend human vision to the very edge of the universe.
Seven years behind schedule, the telescope will be deployed by astronaut Steven Hawley, an astronomer, on a day that many scientists were beginning to doubt they would ever see.
"It's been long and frustrating," conceded Edward Weiler, program scientist for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, who was visibly shaken by the launch.
"Every astronomer," he said softly, "should take today off."
"After 12 years," astronomer Eric Chaisson of the Space Telescope Science Institute said with a sigh, "it has finally left the Earth."
High above the haze of the Earth's atmosphere, the Hubble is expected to produce images 10 times sharper than even the largest telescopes on Earth today.
Then scientists will begin studying some of the dimmest and most distant objects in the universe.
After the deployment, engineers at the Goddard Space Flight Center will begin the tedious process of activating the telescope.
In about seven days the Hubble should snap its first picture -- what astronomers call "first light" for the telescope -- but it will be primarily an engineering exercise and the image is not expected to amount to much.
Weiler estimated that only about one-third of the people who were here April 10 made it back for Tuesday's launch.
This is the second flight for Charles F. Bolden Jr., 43, the pilot, and mission specialists Bruce McCandless, 52, and Kathryn D. Sullivan, 38.
The solar arrays keep the telescope's high-tech batteries charged, and if they are not fully deployed within six hours after the telescope is lifted out of the cargo bay, the batteries will have discharged to the point that some instruments in the telescope could be damaged.
