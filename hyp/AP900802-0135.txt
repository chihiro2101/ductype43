Iraq's powerful army invaded this small oil-rich kingdom early today.
Tank-led troops quickly seized the ruler's palace and government buildings, and the emir fled to Saudi Arabia, Kuwaiti officials said.
Kuwait's U.S. ambassador said the Iraqis occupied all government buildings in the capital and were moving south toward the country's oil facilities.
A Pentagon source said U.S. Navy ships were diverted to the region, but President Bush said the subject of intervention was not being discussed.
``The Iraqis have occupied all of Kuwait!''
Diplomatic sources in the Persian Gulf estimated that more than 200 Kuwaitis were killed or wounded.
The Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein claimed it invaded at the request of revolutionaries who had already staged a coup and established ``The Provisional Government of Free Kuwait.''
Kuwait and U.N. diplomats labeled the coup report a farce.
Saddam also accused Kuwait of exceeding OPEC production quotas, thus driving down the price of oil, a major Iraqi revenue source.
The Soviet Union, Iraq's main arms supplier, halted weapons sales.
_The U.N. Security Council voted 14-0 to denounce the invasion and demanded immediate withdrawal of Iraqi troops.
Kuwait's U.S. ambassador, Sheik Saud Nasir al-Sabah, told reporters in Washington: ``We are desperate for any help we can get.''
In recent days, diplomats said Iraq had massed more than 100,000 troops at the border.
Residents said the palace was seized after about two hours of heavy artillery barrages.
``We were totally unprepared,'' said Catherine Baker of Illinois.
``One feels like there should have been a bit of warning.''
The British Embassy was hit by shell-fire and the Sheraton and Hilton hotels evacuated their clientele, the diplomats said.
