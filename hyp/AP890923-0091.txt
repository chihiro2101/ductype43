Family members on Saturday grieved for their slain loved ones and criticized the security arrangements at the Royal Marines Music School, where an IRA terrorist attack killed 10 military musicians.
Jean Cleatheroe, whose son Andrew was killed, joined local residents and opposition politicians in denouncing the use of private security firms to protect the music school and 29 other military establishments in Britain.
British military installations are a frequent target of the IRA's campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province with the mainly Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.
Friday's attack was the worst since July 1982, when 11 servicemen were fatally wounded in bombings in central London.
Shocked residents of Deal gathered outside the barracks to lay flowers in tribute to the young men they called the ``Bandies.''
I hate the people who did this to them,'' said Scott Roberts.
Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, spiritual leader of the Church of England, visited the injured and said he was impressed ``by their strength and determination that evil will not defeat them.''
