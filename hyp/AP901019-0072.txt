For the New York Philharmonic, it was supposed to be a night of Beethoven and Shostakovich.
The fates made it a night of Leonard Bernstein.
The official catalog of his works says Bernstein led 74 orchestras.
But this was HIS orchestra, and the musicians came to pay tribute to THEIR laureate conductor, who led them through 1,244 concerts during his 47-year association with the Philharmonic.
They let his music do the talking.
The substitute Bernstein program was being repeated Friday night, Saturday and Tuesday.
There weren't many smiling faces among the audience or musicians.
Slatkin's brief introductory comments, followed by the whimsical ``Candide,'' broke some of the tension.
Then came the eclectic ``Serenade,'' which Bernstein's program notes says is supposed to be based on Plato's ``Symposium.''
It begins with a lyrical praise of the Eros, the god of love.
The piece is sometimes jocular, sometimes melancholy, sometimes assaulting and sometimes hedonistic.
It ends in drunken revelry, an intrusion of jazz - as if Bernstein was looking down from heaven and telling the audience, ``It's O.K. to smile tonight.''
Judea is exiled.
