THE PHOTOGRAPHER caught Winnie Mandela as she left the court after her conviction for kidnapping.
She was smiling exuberantly, as if she had just won a great victory.
Behind her was Nelson Mandela, eyes downcast, looking stricken and exhausted.
Most of all, it reminded us of the unimaginable burdens borne by one 72-year-old man.
In the 15 months since he walked free from prison, Nelson Mandela has played the chief role in talks with President F.W. de Klerk and the white government.
The radicals in the ANC may well use the trial and conviction of Mrs. Mandela to arouse members against Nelson Mandela's policy of peace and negotiation.
One reason for a degree of optimism is the way South Africans on all sides, most of them, have dealt with Winnie Mandela's trial: calmly and fairly.
But from all one can tell, this trial was handled professionally by the judge, Justice Michael Stegmann.
A more fundamental reason for hope is that F.W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela -- and those for whom they speak -- have a common interest in creating a new, non-racial South Africa.
