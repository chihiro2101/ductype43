Rescue workers coped with aftershocks and heavy rain today in an effort to reach remote regions of the Himalayas to help victims of an earthquake whose official death toll neared 700.
Rumors predicting another large quake sent thousands of panic-stricken people fleeing from their homes in India and Nepal.
Sunday's pre-dawn quake registered 6.5 on the Richter scale and claimed at least 497 lives in Nepal and 200 in India, government officials said.
Officials in both countries said they expected the death toll to climb when reports arrived from regions difficult to reach even in good weather.
In Biratnagar, a city near the Indian border 150 miles east of the Nepalese capital Katmandu, residents poured into the streets before dawn today as men ran from houses to house, shouting that a message came from Katmandu that a new quake was expected before dawn.
Anonymous telephone calls with similar rumors roused hundreds of people in Katmandu, also before dawn.
A quake registering 5.1 on the Richter scale shook eastern Nepal late Monday afternoon, but there were no immediate reports of new casualties or damage.
Madhav Prasad Pandy, senior seismologist at Nepal's Department of Geology, said in Katmandu.
Tremors flattened more than 25,000 houses in India, officials said, and the Bhoothai Balan River flooded nearly 50 villages in the Madhubani district.
Niranjan Thapa of the Home Minstry reported extensive damage in 21 of Nepal's 75 districts and at least four affected districts reported 50 or more deaths.
