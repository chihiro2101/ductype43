It's a dog's life for Bill McFadden.
The 32-year-old professional dog handler knows that the secret to producing champions is just plain, doggone hard work.
And, like a racehorse jockey, he crisscrosses the country showing the dogs for a variety of owners.
McFadden and his wife, Taffe, run their dog handling business in Campbell and do it primarily for the enjoyment and satisfaction it brings.
Before a show we sometimes work around the clock brushing and cleaning the dogs, working on their coats," said McFadden. "
McFadden said he handles an average of 20 to 25 dogs at each show and works around 120 shows a year all over the U.S.
Kerrageen's Hotspur was scheduled to join McFadden in New York City last week for the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show at Madison Square Garden.
