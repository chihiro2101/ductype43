Joseph B. Gildenhorn, the lawyer and real estate developer named by President Bush as U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, and his immediate family gave nearly $230,000 to Republican campaigns since 1984, disclosure statements show.
One of a lengthy and growing list of Bush supporters and contributors named to diplomatic posts, Gildenhorn gave $100,000 during the 1988 presidential campaign to the Republican National State Elections Committee.
The gift was not subject to the disclosure requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act.
``Mr. Gildenhorn has been a strong Republican supporter being a member of the Eagles and Team 100,'' the State Department said.
Gildenhorn's political contributions are listed on a disclosure form submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which has set a hearing on the nomination for this week.
He gave $2,500 in 1985 and $5,000 in 1986 to the Fund for the American Future, a Bush political action committee and contributed the legal limit of $1,000 to the Bush campaign in 1987.
