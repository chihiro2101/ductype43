Lucille Ball, whose death Wednesday morning at the age of 77 will be the most widely and deeply felt show-business loss in recent memory, was the movies' greatest gift to television.
It turned out to be one of Sam Goldwyn's finest and most prophetic hours when he signed her as one of his Goldwyn Girls to appear in "Roman Scandals" with Eddie Cantor in 1933.
She had had bit parts in two earlier films but "Roman Scandals" was the one that gave her a firmer foothold on the slippery slopes of a Hollywood career.
She perfected her matchless craft as a comedienne in dozens of films, including three of Fred Astaire's and one of the Marx Brothers ("Room Service").
Yet as often happened with supporting performers, her verve, an engagingly sharp tongue and a rather salty view of the world made her more interesting than the square-cut principals, and led to leading roles.
Today many sitcoms still use the three-camera technique, shooting in front of live audiences, that Desi Arnaz pioneered.
Her foils -- Desi himself, Vivian Vance and William Frawley -- were superb farceurs themselves, but Lucy was the dynamo that made it all work.
The irony is that, created by the movies, she was to achieve fame and fortune in television on a scale that had eluded her in the movies.
