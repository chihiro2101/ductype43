The beer gridiron is going to be a busy and expensive place on television this January.
The nation's two largest brewers, Anheuser Busch Cos. Inc. and Miller Brewing Co., are gearing up to sell their beer with by staging mock football games in television commercials in conjunction with Super Bowl XXIV in New Orleans.
Executives from both companies say they're attempting to take advantage of the weeks of hype surrounding the game.
Anheuser Busch is staging a ``Bud Bowl II'' ad campaign that culminates during the Jan. 28 Super Bowl, with a game featuring animated teams of Budweiser and Bud Light beer bottles rattling around on a pint-sized football field.
Miller, based in Milwaukee, won't say exactly how much it is spending on its 12-week, pre-Super Bowl campaign centered on a football game between a ``Tastes Great'' team and a ``Less Filling'' squad.
