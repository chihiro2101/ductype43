At the news conference -- Gorbachev's first since the coup against him collapsed on Wednesday -- the 60-year-old leader condemned the takeover as being against "the people, against democracy."
"I said I wouldn't make any deals," he said then. "
Gorbachev detailed his purge of coup leaders, including Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov.
Gorbachev pledged cooperation with Russian republic President Boris Yeltsin but said he had no plans to leave the Communist Party.
I am an adherent of socialism."
"We have to see this as an enormous opportunity," he said.
"Everything was done to weaken me psychologically," Gorbachev said.
He said that early on in the coup, he tried to find out who was behind it.
"I picked up one of the telephones I have and it wasn't working.
I picked up a second, a third, a fourth . . .
that my communication be restored and that an airplane be brought immediately so I could be returned to Moscow," he said.
Gorbachev said the coup leaders demanded that he resign.
He called the crisis "one of the most difficult trials of the entire history" of his six-year rule.
"You know that it appeared as though they might have done something to me.
