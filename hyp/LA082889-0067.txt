Dave Johnson of the United States clinched the decathlon gold medal in the final event at the World University Games Sunday.
Johnson trailed Mikhail Medved of the Soviet Union by 11 points before the 1,500-meter race, the final event of the two-day competition.
"It's the hardest I've ever worked in my life," said Johnson, of Montclair, Calif.
"I was scared to death.
I knew I had to run at my best or even better to win."
That gave him 727 points for a winning total of 8,216, 154 more than Medved.
The Soviet had a time of 4:59.60 in the race, worth 562 points, and ended up second with a total of 8,062.
But he was overtaken by Dezso Szabo of Hungary and had to settle for fourth place at 7,906.
Vladimir Budko of the Soviet Union was a distant second in 50.30, with Henderson, of Auburn, Ala., third in 50.57.
