A son of the late publishing magnate Robert Maxwell thinks there is no chance Maxwell employees will recover any of the hundreds of millions of dollars in pension funds that disappeared, a report said today.
Kevin Maxwell also was quoted as saying that much of the criticism calling his father a crook is fair and that there's "not the remotest possibility" his father's death a month ago was a suicide.
Investigators have said Maxwell siphoned money from his companies in a desperate attempt to deal with his empire's crushing debts.
They also have said some questionable transactions may have occurred after Maxwell's death.
In an interview published today by the Daily Mirror, Robert Maxwell's London flagship newspaper, Kevin Maxwell was quoted as saying of the pensioners:
One week ago, the Serious Fraud Office, a government prosecution agency, began investigating Mirror Group Newspapers PLC's pension fund assets and related matters.
In a report today, The Washington Post quoted unidentified sources as saying Robert Maxwell never created the pension fund for Daily News managers he promised to start with funding from Tribune Co., which sold the paper to Maxwell.
