Clarence Thomas completed five grueling days of Senate questioning Monday, apparently well on his way to becoming the second black justice in the history of the Supreme Court.
"I have been honored to participate in this process," Thomas said before breaking into a broad grin and effusively gripping the hands of his Judiciary Committee interrogators.
The committee will continue to hear testimony for and against Thomas at least through the end of the week, but the outcome does not seem to be in doubt.
Several committee members said they expected the committee to recommend, by a 10-4 or 9-5 vote, that the Senate confirm Thomas.
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., delivered a long, stinging lecture to Thomas, declaring: "The vanishing views of Judge Thomas have become a major issue in these hearings."
Thomas told the Judiciary Committee that "philosophically, there is nothing that would bother me personally about upholding it (the death penalty) in appropriate cases."
