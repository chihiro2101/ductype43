Recordings by Leonard Bernstein, one of the most documented conductors in history, will undergo expanded release programs following the conductor's death on Sunday, said representatives of the recording companies controlling the late Bernstein's catalogues.
Executives of Sony Classical and Deutsche Grammophon, which control the bulk of Bernstein's recorded legacy, and BMG Classics/RCA Red Seal plan to step up timetables to deliver more Bernstein recordings to the marketplace.
In fact, the only new recordings will be out next month -- as originally scheduled, reported Karen Moody, vice president of Deutsche Grammophon.
At Sony Classical (formerly CBS Records) in New York City, Peter Munves, director of marketing, said this week that in January the company will begin its three-year release of "The Bernstein Collection": "We will release 75 CDs of Bernstein performances, including not only symphonic music by Beethoven and others, but also oratorio performances -- works by Haydn, and the Requiems by Berlioz and Verdi -- and other music never before released on CD."
At Deutsche Grammophon, also in New York, Wende Persons, director of promotion, reported: "We are looking at (Bernstein's) active DG discography, which contains over 100 different recordings, and making sure everything is available.
"That's 120 titles (of standard classical repertory) and some of Bernstein's own (non-theatrical) music, plus another dozen videos."
In August, Deutsche Grammophon released in this country a 12-CD set of Bernstein recordings with the Vienna Philharmonic, Israel Philharmonic and L.A. Philharmonic.
