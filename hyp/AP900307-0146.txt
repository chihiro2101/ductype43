Moslems blew up a truck carrying security forces Wednesday, killing three soldiers in the few hours the government relaxed a curfew designed to stop the Kashmiri separatist uprising, officials said.
In separate incidents, militants shot and killed a Moslem they said was a police informer and a Moslem died after he was caught in an exchange of fire between militants and security forces, officials said.
Also Wednesday, Moslem snipers fired on security forces in three parts of Srinagar during a five-hour relaxation of curfew, said Gov. Jagmohan of Jammu-Kashmir state.
The curfew was relaxed from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m. to allow people in the city of 1 million to shop for food and other essentials.
An around-the-clock curfew was imposed Friday after security forces the day before shot and killed 49 Moslem demonstrators marching into Srinagar to take part in a pro-independence rally.
At least 1 million Moslems demonstrated to demand independence for the predominantly Moslem state; India is predominantly Hindu.
Leading national parties decided Wednesday to send a ``high-powered delegation'' to Srinagar, according to the Press Trust of India news agency.
It did not name the members, but it said they would go Thursday.
