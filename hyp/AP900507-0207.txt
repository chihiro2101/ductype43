Forty years after Sam Walton first hung out his shingle, Walton's 5&amp;10 will reopen to show how a little rural storekeeper built a discount retail empire.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Visitors Center opens Wednesday in the same building on the downtown square where Walton first opened for business on May 9, 1950.
The center chronicles the rise of the nation's fastest-growing discount chain, using displays and audio-video presentations.
It concentrates on how the free enterprise system works and how Wal-Mart thrived when similar companies didn't.
The window displays date back to the store's opening, with Simplicity patterns and Johnson's Glo-Coat, a box of Dreft and some Ivory Snow.
Also on display at the center is the hula skirt that Sam Walton donned for his ``dance on Wall Street,'' which he performed after challenging the company to reach a record 8 percent pre-tax profit in 1984.
The old and the modern together reflect the corporate culture of the nation's biggest discount retailer behind K mart Corp. of Detroit.
Sam's Wholesale Club closed out the year with 123 units and Wal-Mart announced plans to enter the California market.
