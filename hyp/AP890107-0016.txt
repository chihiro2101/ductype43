TOKYO (AP _ Emperor Hirohito will be remembered for one overwhelming decision during his 62-year reign: Japan must bow to defeat for the first time in its history and end the Pacific conflict in World War II.
Shortly after that decision, and for most of his reign, Hirohito became a figurehead, isolated from his subjects by tradition and steeped in his great love, the study of marine biology.
He was the last survivor among the national leaders of the World War II era.
But it was his first effective decision as emperor, and his most courageous, that ended the Pacific conflict.
``I cannot bear to see my innocent people suffer any longer,'' he said.
``Ending the war is the only way to restore world peace and to relieve the nation from the terrible distress with which it is burdened.''
``The time has come when we must bear the unbearable.''
Three weeks later, Hirohito donned a silk cutaway coat, striped trousers and a top hat to meet the Allied commander, Gen. Douglas A. MacArthur, at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo.
It was a choice that enabled Hirohito to remain as the symbolic head of his nation and assured that he would not face charges as a war criminal, as some abroad had demanded.
The emperor's status in the eyes of many Japanese changed to that of a kind uncle.
He became a widely respected authority on marine biology.
A nationwide survey by the daily newspaper Mainichi Shimbun in March 1987 indicated more than 80 percent of 2,184 people polled supported the imperial system, while only 11 percent said it should be abolished.
Despite the humanization of the Imperial family, Hirohito remained under strict control of the Imperial Household Agency.
Hirohito visited England, Scotland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy, receiving various decorations.
