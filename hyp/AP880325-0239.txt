What do Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, Cary Grant, Alfred Hitchcock and Steven Spielberg have in common?
They have never won Academy Awards for their individual achievements.
Such flagrant omissions are often cited by critics as evidence of the unfairness of Hollywood's highest prize.
The latest casualties are directors James L. Brooks, whose movie ``Broadcast News'' was nominated though he wasn't, and Spielberg who was left out in the cold with his ``Empire of the Sun.''
Brooks did better in 1984 when his ``Terms of Endearment'' took the lion's share of Oscars, including best picture and director.
Spielberg's ``Empire of the Sun'' won six nominations this year, none of them major and none for director.
Two years ago, ``The Color Purple'' received 11 nominations but not for him as director.
There was no mention of the fact that Spielberg is primarily a director, not a producer.
Douglas Fairbanks, Judy Garland, Noel Coward, Ernst Lubitsch, Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Harold Lloyd, Greta Garbo, Maurice Chevalier, Stan Laurel, Cary Grant, Lillian Gish, Edward G. Robinson, Groucho Marx, Howard Hawks and Jean Renoir are others who have received honorary awards.
The only Oscar for ``Citizen Kane'' was for the script.
