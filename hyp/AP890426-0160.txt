Lucille Ball was mourned Wednesday by the western New York hometown she left for Hollywood more than half a century ago.
``It is a sad day for all of us.
But I'm sure that feeling is shared by many people around the world,'' said Nelson Garifi, organizer of a homecoming for Miss Ball that was to have been held next month.
``She was always so full of life,'' said Pauline Lopus, who went to school with Miss Ball and had kept in touch with her.
The 77-year-old comedian died of a ruptured aorta, the main heart artery, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where she was recovering from emergency heart surgery last week.
Although the comedian hadn't visited Jamestown since 1956 and had no family there, she regularly donated money to charities, civic events and Jamestown Community College, said Mayor Steven Carlson.
