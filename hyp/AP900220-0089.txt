Pakistani and Indian troops exchanged fire for several hours today after a Pakistani soldier became the first military casualty on the troubled Kashmir border, officers and a western observer said.
The soldier was shot in the leg Sunday at a ceasefire line, several miles from the village of Chaukothi, officials said on condition of anonymity.
They said there were no reports of casualties from today's firefight at the line, which divides Kashmir between Pakistan and India.
The militants want India's only majority Moslem state to either become independent or join Pakistan.
The border crossing was the scene of a bloody confrontation on Feb. 11 between Indian troops and Pakistani students, who were marching in solidarity with activists in Indian-held Kashmir.
``We are trying to tie the people down,'' said Amir Alan Khan, a retired lieutenant colonel who heads Kashmir's civil defence.
