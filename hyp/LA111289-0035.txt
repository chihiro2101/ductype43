One year after his election, Dan Quayle has achieved all he ever wanted: He has become dull.
His coming-out party last Sunday was a true test of his new ability to not make news.
He went on "Meet the Press."
He didn't appear on "Meet the Press" or "This Week With David Brinkley" or "Face the Nation."
And he didn't do so because back then he was making too much news.
His every slip, his every gaffe, his every goof was news.
So when Quayle got to Washington, he got there with one goal: Support the President and make himself a very small target.
Stay out of the headlines and give no reason for anyone to dump him in 1992.
We renewed our request and then after saying he would not do the show, he changed his mind and said he would.
And it says something about Dan Quayle's reputation that he would be considered "above and beyond" the usual guest.
That's because vice presidents don't actually do anything.
As George Bush once joked about his duties as vice president: "You die; I fly."
He might make a mistake or say something outrageous or disagree with the President.
And, oh yeah, Bush had said Dan Quayle would be on the ticket in 1992.
Many thought it was a terrible choice, but there is nothing like a victory to give everything a rosy glow.
And Bush's announcement that Quayle would be his running mate again was Bush's way of saying: "I didn't screw up the first time.
I asked Christie Basham of "Meet the Press" if Quayle had asked in advance who the questioners would be. "
Quayle's questioners were David Broder of the Washington Post and Elizabeth Drew of the New Yorker, both of whom stuck to serious questions.
