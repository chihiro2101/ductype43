An intestinal operation to lower the cholesterol of heart attack patients reduced their risk for another heart attack or death from heart disease, researchers said today.
The surgery, called a partial ileal bypass, has one significant drawback:
In the operation, doctors change the route of the small intestine so about one-third of it is bypassed.
This reduces the amount of cholesterol that is absorbed into the bloodstream.
The $52 million, 17-year study was conducted on people who had already suffered heart attacks.
Dr. Henry Buchwald of the University of Minnesota, who directed the study, said the surgery should be considered along with cholesterol-lowering drugs as a possible standard treatment.
The study was conducted in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Little Rock, Ark., and published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
