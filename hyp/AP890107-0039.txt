World leaders from President Reagan to Malaysia's king mourned today's death of Emperor Hirohito, who surrendered a broken nation to the Allies in World War II but presided over its rise to economic pre-eminence.
Reaction to Hirohito's death at age 87, however, was decidedly cool in several Asian countries, including South Korea, which endured years of harsh colonial rule by Japan.
While South Korea President Roh Tae-Woo sent his condolences, a government party statement added, ``We reserve further comment, considering the unhappy past and the current Korea-Japan relationship.''
The main opposition party led by Kim Dae-jung said, ``We have complex feelings at the death of Hirohito in view of Japan's 20-year rule over Korea during his reign.''
Korea was divided into the communist north and the capitalist south in 1945, when U.S. and Soviet troops ended Japan's rule that began in 1910 with Japan's forced annexation of the peninsula.
There was no official comment from the nationalist Chinese government because of the lack of diplomatic relations between Taiwan and Japan, but the mass circulation Chinese daily United Evening News said:
``Asian people who suffered from the slavery and invasion of Japan's militarists during World War II may bury their animosity with Hirohito's death. ...
Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia paid his respects in a message to Japanese Prime Minister Noburu Takeshita: ``Throughout his long life, the emperor was held in the highest esteem by his people.
