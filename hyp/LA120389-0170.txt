Philippine Vice President and opposition leader Salvador H. Laurel declined Saturday night to condemn the armed insurrection in his country and said the rebels "have the right" to try to seize power.
Laurel also said that the rebels will not surrender to President Corazon Aquino's forces, as she has demanded.
He predicted that the fighting may turn to civil war if reported rebel reinforcements arrive from Cebu, Mindanao and other islands.
"I don't think this is going to end right away," he said in a suite in the Peninsula Hotel here.
Since then, Laurel has criticized Aquino frequently in his role as head of the opposition Nacionalista Party.
Laurel said he was in London early Friday when the Philippine fighting began.
He flew to Hong Kong but was stranded here with scores of journalists because the Philippines' two international airports, in Manila and Cebu, have been closed since the fighting began.
Laurel criticized Aquino for asking the United States to help bolster her beleaguered forces Friday.
But Laurel said the U.S. fighter-bombers destroyed a Philippine air force fuel dump and other facilities at Sangley Point and fired rockets that killed civilians near Camp Aguinaldo, the armed forces headquarters.
