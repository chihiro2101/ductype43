John Major, endorsed by Margaret Thatcher as the politician closest to her heart, was elected by the Conservative Party Tuesday night to succeed her as prime minister.
Major, 47, fell two votes short of winning a majority in voting among the 372 Coservative Party members of Parliament, but his two opponents quickly conceded defeat and the party confirmed Major as the winner.
Mrs. Thatcher, ending 11{ years in power, intended to submit her resignation to Queen Elizabeth II on Wednesday morning, and Major would then be called to lead the government.
Major, the chancellor of the exchequer, emerged from his official residence at 11 Downing St. Tuesday night smiling and holding hands with his wife, Norma.
Inside, Mrs. Thatcher, who came next door from the prime minister's 10 Downing Street residence, embraced Major.
``It is a very exciting thing to become leader of the Conservative Party, and particularly exciting, I think, to follow one of the most remarkable leaders the Conservative Party has ever had,'' Major said.
We are going to unite totally and absolutely, and we're going to win the next general election,'' said Major, who will be the youngest British prime minister in this century.
Former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine received 131 and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had 56.
The party had been torn by the sudden and unexpected leadership challenge by Heseltine, who last week stopped Mrs. Thatcher short of victory in the first round of the leadership race.
Howe, the fourth Cabinet member to resign because of disputes over policy toward the European Community, shocked the House of Commons on Nov. 13 by calling Mrs. Thatcher a threat to Britain's vital interests.
The Conservatives' main rivals, the socialist Labor Party, demanded a general election.
``It means that the policies that brought the poll tax, recession, heavy mortgages and rising unemployment will go on.''
