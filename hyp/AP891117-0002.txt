Federal aid was approved Friday for tornado-ravaged Huntsville, where 17 died and several hundred were injured or lost their homes, and Gov. Guy Hunt toured hospitals and visited with grieving families.
``I've been around a lot of tornadoes, but I've not seen the type of damage on as broad a scale as I've seen this morning,''
Hunt said after a helicopter tour of the 10-mile-long path of destruction.
State emergency management officials estimated the damage in excess of $100 million in the agency's letter to President Bush requesting a disaster declaration, said Terry Abbott, the governor's press secretary.
``I've never seen as much rubble from a tornado before,'' said Danny Cooper, the state agency's director.
Wind in the tornado was estimated at 250 mph when the twister hit Wednesday afternoon.
President Bush issued a disaster declaration Friday morning to clear the way for tornado victims to receive federal relief.
``To look at that building, it's hard to understand why more people were not killed,'' Hunt said.
