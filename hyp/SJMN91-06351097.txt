U.S. Navy aircraft joined the search today for survivors of the ferry sinking that left 471 people missing in shark-infested Red Sea waters but found nothing but empty life rafts and debris.
Investigators, meanwhile, were looking into complaints from some of the 178 survivors that the crew of the Salem Express abandoned ship without helping them into lifeboats or flotation gear.
They also want to know why the ferry strayed outside standard navigational channels.
Prime Minister Atef Sidki, who traveled to Safaga, said many passengers may have been on lifeboats driven far from the wreck scene by strong winds.
Ahmed Gamal Sobhi, Safaga's city council chairman, said only four bodies were recovered by Egyptian vessels and helicopters and the time nightfall and bad weather stopped Sunday's search.
The weather improved today as two helicopters from the U.S. Navy frigate Aubrey Fitch, which joined in the rescue effort on Sunday night, and a Navy P-3 submarine-chaser aircraft made their first daylight search runs, said Lt. Cmdr.
The Salem Express was near the end of a 36-hour trip from Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, to Safaga, about 290 miles south of Cairo.
Many of the passengers were Muslims returning from off-season pilgrimages to Mecca and others were returning to Egypt after stints as guest workers in Saudi Arabia.
