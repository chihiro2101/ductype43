After years of delay and a last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope was freed from the shuttle Discovery on Wednesday and, glinting in the sunlight, drifted into orbit on its 15-year search for new worlds.
Mission specialist Steven Hawley released Hubble from the end of the shuttle's 50-foot-long mechanical arm after a delay in getting one of the telescope's solar wings unfurled.
``The first of NASA's great observatories is now on station at 330 nautical miles above the Earth,'' Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said.
``The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and we sure hope it does good work,''
The $1.5 billion telescope was released at 3:38 p.m. EDT as the shuttle entered its 20th orbit of Earth, nearly two hours and one orbit later than planned.
The shuttle then backed away.
``Thank you very much for the ride,'' said Mike Harrington, director of orbital verifications at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan had been in the shuttle's airlock, ready to walk inspace to free the solar panel.
``Close but no cigar, but better for the Hubble that it went the way it did,'' Sullivan said.
It started providing power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge.
Hawley began the long process of releasing Hubble shortly after 7 a.m. EDT when he grasped it with Discovery's 50-foot-long mechanical arm and carefully hoisted the 12{-ton telescope high above the shuttle.
Television cameras aboard Discovery showed the first array as it was pulled from its reel slowly but steadily, the sun reflecting off the gold-colored panel and silvery telescope.
``I'd like to pass on the quote of the day from the on-board astronomer something to the effect that the big marble sure looks far away today,''
If all goes well, the crew will land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
