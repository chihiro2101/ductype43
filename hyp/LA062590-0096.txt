Orange County's Iranian community launched an ambitious effort Sunday to collect half a million dollars in money, medicine, tents, blankets and sleeping bags for hundreds of thousands of injured and homeless people in earthquake-ravaged Iran.
Representatives of 11 Iranian professional and community groups manned tables near William R. Mason Regional Park, where contributors dropped off supplies, pledged other aid or made financial contributions.
Organizers said they hope to raise at least $500,000 in donations.
"We'll do this as long as it takes," said organizer Bijan Kian.
The new shock, with a magnitude of 5.7, toppled the few still-standing structures and caused mudslides that temporarily closed the road linking Rasht with other destruction zones in Zanjan province.
But police accommodated the group, blocking off a bike lane on University Avenue so cars could pull in and unload supplies for the earthquake victims.
Organizer Genia Panahi, 40, of Newport Beach, said the 150 Iranian doctors practicing in Orange County responded to calls for medicine, surgical gloves, disposable needles and blood bags.
The group -- the Orange County Committee for Iran Earthquake Relief -- has set up a special account at Capital Bank in Santa Ana.
Red Cross representative Sylvia Stewart said the Red Cross will accept only monetary contributions because shipping supplies there is very expensive.
at California State Fullerton has set up a booth in Parking Lot C near State College Boulevard and Nutwood Avenue.
The donations will be forwarded to the Red Cross or they may be sent directly to the Red Cross, P.O. Box 11364, Santa Ana, CA.
