As a young girl in western New York, Lucille Ball hawked hot dogs and popcorn at an amusement park as she dreamed of starring in movies, hometown friends recalled.
``She always talked about being a star,'' said Pauline Lopus, who went to school with Miss Ball and had kept in touch with her.
Miss Ball, born 60 miles south of Buffalo in Jamestown on Aug. 6, 1911, grew up in nearby Celoron, a rural hamlet on Chautauqua Lake.
Mrs. Lopus remembered the sitcom star on Wednesday as ``daring in many ways.''
At 15, Miss Ball worked as a barker at the amusement park, screaming for people to buy popcorn and hot dogs until she lost her voice.
Miss Ball regularly donated money to charities, civic events and Jamestown Community College, said Jamestown Mayor Steven Carlson.
Garifi, community relations director for the community college, said the honorary degree will be awarded posthumously.
