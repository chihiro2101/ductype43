Last year a biography of Mrs Norma Major - or, if we are being old-fashioned, Mrs John Major - claimed that the Majors' favourite film was Being There.
I entirely concur with their choice.
In case you did not see that marvellous film, this, in essence, was the plot:
a man no one knows anything about, a gardener called Chauncey, rises without trace to become, by the end of the film, a serious candidate for the US presidency.
In Chauncey's bromides everyone seems to hear what they want to believe.
John Major must, at some level, have appreciated the similarity between his own, strangely intangible, rise and that of Chauncey's.
Francis Wheen of The Guardian, a keen student of Major's mysterious past, immediately rang 10 Downing Street, which claimed that Major's father farmed near Bromsgrove in 1910.
As Wheen pointed out, Major was an unresponsive minus 33 years old at that time, and - a minor point this - Bromsgrove is not in Shropshire.
A farmer for Farmers Weekly, a Pittsburgh steelworker for the American audience . . .
If John Major were a different sort of politician, this would be a point barely worth making.
Margaret Thatcher was notoriously dogmatic, even in public, and so too was Edward Heath, even though he always pretended to be a 'consensus politician'.
