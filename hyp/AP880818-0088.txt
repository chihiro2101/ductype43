A drug used to treat patients complaining of chest pain also could help prevent recurring heart attacks in four out of five heart patients, according to a study published in today's edition of the New England Journal of Medicine.
Surprisingly, however, the study found that the drug, diltiazem, increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack in patients whose hearts pump abnormally, experts said.
The drug was tested in 38 hospitals in the United States and Canada on patients who had recently suffered a heart attack, said Dr. Arthur Moss, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Rochester and the principal investigator for the study.
The results suggest the drug may be quite effective in decreasing the likelihood of a second heart attack in the majority of patients, Moss said.
Dr. John Schroeder, a cardiologist and professor at Stanford University, said he was surprised that the drug increased the chance of heart attack in any group and that overall results were not higher.
Diltiazem and two other calcium entry blockers were introduced in the past decade, Beller said, and research into how effective they are in various applications is in its early stages.
