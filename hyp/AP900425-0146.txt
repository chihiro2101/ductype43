Discovery's astronauts overcame balky equipment to send the Hubble Space Telescope floating free from the shuttle today on a 15-year quest for secrets of the universe.
The $1.5 billion telescope began orbiting Earth every 97.3 minutes at an altitude of 380 miles _ high above the atmosphere, which has limited the view of ground-based telecopes.
``Discovery, go for Hubble release,'' Mission Control told the crew at 3:37 p.m. EDT.
The event occurred a minute later as the shuttle slowly and carefully backed away.
The final hours before its release were a nightmare for ground controllers as they commanded the unfurling of two solar panels that power the telescope's instruments.
``So we have good news,'' said Dave Drachlis, of the Hubble control center.
``Precisely one day after lifting off from Launch Pad 39B at Kennedy Space Center, the Hubble Space Telescope is ready to fly on its own,'' Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said.
Cameras aboard Discovery showed the telescope, being held at the end of a 50-foot crane, reflecting sunlight from its silver surface and a turning Earth in the background.
Controllers monitoring the telescope at Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland said Tuesday that no problems had been detected so far aboard Hubble, the most expensive and complex unmanned spacecraft ever built.
It finally got a ride into orbit Tuesday morning aboard Discovery.
