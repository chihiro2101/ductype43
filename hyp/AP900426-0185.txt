Ground controllers cheered after re-establishing contact Thursday with the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope through its main antennas.
``I'm pretty relieved, I must say,'' said Al Boggess, Hubble project scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
Applause erupted at Goddard's Space Telescope Operations Control Center when the high-speed contact was made Thursday afternoon.
Controllers sent information to the telescope about its location, and ``this basically improved the telescope's knowledge where it was, what its position was,'' said Goddard's Dave Drachlis.
The antennas are the primary communications links for relaying scientific information to the ground.
Controllers' lack of experience with the new satellite was part of the problem, Boggess said.
Two low-speed antennas were working fine, but Boggess said they would be ``excruciatingly slow'' for sending data.
The problems won't delay the schedule for putting the telescope into use, said Jean Oliver, Hubble deputy project manager at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
On Tuesday, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration releases its first image from the telescope, an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.
