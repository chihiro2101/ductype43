Henry Carley lives on the west side of town, a couple of miles from Tampa Stadium.
The last time the Super Bowl was played there, in 1984, he felt as distant from all the hoopla as if he were 1,000 miles away, he recalls.
Carley, the president of the local chapter of the NAACP, had no interest in being inside the stadium.
Things are different
He says he only wished the black community could have shared in some of the considerable profits generated by one of America's greatest sports events.
"The Super Bowl is about money," Carley said last week.
"And last time we were basically onlookers."
The grand marshal of the parade will be Lee Roy Selmon, a former Tampa Bay Buccaneer.
Other events will include a salute to black sports legends and a Doug Williams golf tournament.
This year, the Super Bowl Task Force, a group headed by two of the city's most influential white businessmen, named two black men to head a community-relations committee.
Instead, they canceled the parade.
