The late Jesse Owens, whose performance at the 1936 Olympics put the lie to Hitler's boasts of racial superiority, picked up a fifth gold medal Wednesday for ``humanitarian contributions in the race of life.''
President Bush presented the Congressional Gold Medal to his widow, Ruth Owens, in a ceremony at the White House also attended by three daughters and teammates of the track legend.
The president later hailed Owens's multiple gold medals in the Berlin games ``a victory for humanity'' in prepared remarks to a banquet sponsored by the U.S. Olympic Committee.
``The Olympics, like democracy, are a kind of dialogue _ a way that nations can converse in the language of friendly competition, not deadly conflict,'' Bush said.
``He was always the fastest,'' said Bush, recalling the afternoon in May 1935 when the Ohio State runner broke three world records and tied a fourth in the space of 45 minutes.
Attending the ceremony along with Owens' family were former Olympians Mal Whitfield, Harrison Dillard and Herb Douglass; former teammates John Chavers, Samuel Devine and Chester Thomas, and two Ohio Democrats, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum and Rep. Louis Stokes, who spearheaded the drive to strike the medal.
