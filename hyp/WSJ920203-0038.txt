WASHINGTON -- President Bush plans to name United Nations Ambassador Thomas Pickering as U.S. envoy to India, and appoint the current head of the foreign service to succeed him.
The White House, according to a U.S. official, hasn't yet informed the Senate, which must confirm the nominations of Mr. Pickering and Foreign Service Director General Edward Perkins, a former U.S. envoy to South Africa.
With the end of the Cold War, the U.N. is playing an increasingly important role in working to resolve regional disputes.
Last Friday, during an unprecedented U.N. Security Council meeting of heads of state, President Bush reaffirmed the U.N.'s leading role in peacemaking.
