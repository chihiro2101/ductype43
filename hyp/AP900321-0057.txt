The Berlin villa where the Nazi leadership met to implement the ``final solution'' against Europe's Jewish population will be the site of a World Jewish Congress conference on German reunification.
The New York-based organization announced Tuesday that the meeting is scheduled for May 8, the 45th anniversary of V-E Day.
``The world is expecting a Jewish statement on reunification,'' said Edgar Bronfman, the president of the World Jewish Congress.
``I think that the place where they decided on the `final solution' is the right place to have such a meeting, and the anniversary of the victory in Europe seems to be the right day.''
