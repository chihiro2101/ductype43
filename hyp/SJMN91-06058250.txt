ON A recent day, the telephone rang in the home of William Wegman.
The photographer, known for his hilarious portraits of his Weimaraners, picked up.
Woof.
Their relationship is unusually tender.
One need only listen while Wegman murmurs to Fay Ray and Battina, her 1 1/2-year-old daughter.
On Valentine's Day, for example, he said, "I'll take them out and play with them longer."
Battina begs to differ. "
"I'd never heard of Weimaraners," said the artist, who was born 47 years ago in Longmeadow, Mass.
"He was gray and neutral," the artist said.
When Man Ray, who had become world famous, died of cancer in 1981, at the age of 11 years and 8 months, the artist mourned.
"I dreamed that he came back to life," said Wegman, who spent three years living without a dog.
In 1985, he got Fay Ray, who is now a familiar face not only among artists but among children who watch "Sesame Street."
The dogs eat again at 6 p.m.
