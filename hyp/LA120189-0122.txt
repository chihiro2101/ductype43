As a military coup attempt unfolded in their homeland 7,000 miles away, supporters of the rebellious soldiers engaged in a shouting match Thursday night with supporters of President Corazon Aquino at the Philippine Consulate in Los Angeles.
About 30 members of the Filipino-American Movement for a Better Philippines held a candlelight vigil outside the consulate on Wilshire Boulevard to express sympathy with the coup led by officers linked to renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan.
"We are calling for Mrs. Aquino to step down immediately," said Milo Castelo, 45, a Los Angeles attorney.
Half a dozen television news crews watched as the anti-government protesters confronted the acting consul general for the Philippines in Los Angeles, Willy C. Gaa.
The anti-government protesters then left the consular offices and order was restored.
