UNITED NATIONS
The United States urged other U.N. members at talks Sunday to impose broad economic and military sanctions on Iraq.
Western diplomats said the world body is expected to adopt the measures.
The last time such sanctions were imposed was against the white minority government of Rhodesia.
Western diplomats said they expected up to 14 positive votes on the 15-member council for sanctions against Iraq.
British Ambassador Crispen Tickell told reporters later that he detected ``strong support, with the exception of one member, for action and a vote tomorrow.''
Cuban envoy Ricardo Alarcon said Cuba would vote for sanctions against Iraq only if the council imposed sanctions on South Africa for occupying Namibia, Israel for occupying Palestinian territories and the United States for invading Panama.
