A strong earthquake triggered landslides and destroyed houses in the mountainous India-Nepal border region early Sunday, killing at least 237 people and injuring more than 1,500, officials and news reports said.
Seismologists said it was the deadliest earthquake to strike the Himalayan region since 1950.
Officials in both countries predicted the death toll would rise after they received reports from remote areas which were hit harder.
The temblor also jolted parts of northern Bangladesh and the capital of Dhaka, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.
Witnesses said windows and doors rattled, buildings cracked and people roused from their sleep ran screaming from their homes as objects tumbled from shelves and tables.
The quake also was felt in Sikkim and Tripura, located in the Himalayan foothills, the Press Trust of India news agency said.
In Nepal, a Foreign Ministry official, Shailendra Kumar Upadhyaya, said more than 500 people were injured and thousands of houses collapsed from the quake's impact.
``Most of them (were) buried alive under collapsed houses,'' said Indra Shrestha, a social worker involved in the rescue operation in Dharan Bazar, a township of about 100,000 people about 18 miles from the Indian border.
The Press Trust of India said a school hostel in the town collapsed, killing at least 17 children.
The tremor also was felt in the eastern city of Calcutta, Press Trust of India said.
On Aug. 6 a quake of magnitude 7.3 shook the states of Assam, Manipur, West Bengal and Bihar.
