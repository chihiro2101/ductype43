An explosion rocked the Royal Marines School of Music in a southeastern coastal town today, causing one building to collapse and killing eight people, officials said.
Thirty people were injured and up to 18 were missing and feared trapped in the rubble.
The blast occurred at at 8:26 a.m. in a lounge in the barracks near Deal, about 70 miles southeast of London, the Defense Ministry said.
Firefighters used heavy lifting equipment and thermal cameras to search for those trapped in the debris, said Kent Fire Brigade spokesman Kevin Simmons.
South Eastern British Gas sent investigators to the scene but said there was nothing to indicate the explosion was caused by a gas leak.
In July 1982, eight soldiers died in IRA bombings near the Household Cavalry barracks at Knightsbridge in central London and at a bandstand in the capital's Regent's Park where an army band was playing.
