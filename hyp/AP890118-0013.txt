The 26-year-old drifter with a long criminal record who launched a mute, murderous assault on a California elementary school Tuesday was described by his aunt as a loner and childhood alcoholic, police said.
Patrick E. Purdy purchased an AK-47 rifle in this Portland suburb several months ago, then returned to his hometown of Stockton, Calif., where he used the gun to kill five children and wound 29 others, along with a teacher, at Cleveland Elementary School before taking his own life, authorities said.
Purdy, who went by the alias of Patrick West, had lived with an aunt and uncle in Sandy from the first of July until late October, said Sandy Police Chief Fred Punzel.
He later moved to Lodi, Calif., where he listed his mailing address under the name of his grandmother, Julia Chumbley, although he did not live with her, authorities said.
However, Purdy had an ``extensive criminal history,'' mostly in the Los Angeles area, said Lucian Neely, deputy police chief in Stockton, an agricultural city 60 miles east of San Francisco.
Neely said Purdy originally was from Stockton and that he had purchased the gun at the Sandy Trading Post Aug. 3.
The aunt and uncle last heard from Purdy at Thanksgiving, when he was in Connecticut, Punzel said.
