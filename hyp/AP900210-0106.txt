About 20,000 East Germans, many carrying West German flags, demonstrated Saturday for speedy German reunification, the official East German news agency ADN said.
As the demonstrators rallied in the southern city of Plauen, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in Moscow that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had given him an unequivocal promise to respect German reunification.
Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher also disclosed that they expect a reunification plan with agreement of the World War II Allies to be ready before the end of the year for presentation to a pan-European summit meeting.
Calls for German reunification have increased since the ouster of the hard-line Communist leadership and the opening of East Germany's borders during the fall pro-democracy movement.
He said the Bonn government believes East Germany's foreign debt stands at $18 billion.
