COALMINERS from Romania's Jiu Valley, who spearheaded violent anti-reform rampages through Bucharest in 1990 and 1991, are once again out on strike, pressing the government for higher wages.
But so far the government, unlike its predecessors, has not caved in.
Workers in the same trade union confederation as the miners have ignored appeals by their leaders to strike in solidarity.
The Ministry of Industry argues that the 6m tonnes of pit coal produced each year in the Jiu Valley's 13 mines is not a vital source of energy.
They are also following the call of their charismatic leader, Mr Miron Cosma, the man who led them on protests to Bucharest and secured their earlier wage increases.
Mr Cosma's motive for calling the strike - for which, surprisingly, he has the support of RAH, the state-owned coal mining company - are less obvious.
The ministries of industry and finance are conducting investigations into charges of fraud and embezzlement by Mr Cosma and several senior RAH company officials.
