The 50th anniversary of John Lennon's birth was observed with a global celebration today as his peace anthem ``Imagine'' was played for an estimated 1 billion people in 130 nations.
The song was played shortly after 10 a.m. following a brief ceremony at the United Nations that featured the ex-Beatle's widow, Yoko Ono.
Marcela Perez de Cuellar, wife of the U.N. secretary general, also provided a brief introduction.
A recorded message from the slain Beatle was played as well.
``In celebration of John's life, let's use our power of dreaming,'' Ono said.
``Let's dream of trees growing in abundance, birds flying in clear air, fish swimming in clear water and our children living in joy.
The U.N. Trusteeship Council Chamber was about one-third full with a couple of hundred people for the observance and about 150 people watched on television monitors in the visitors' lobby.
More than 50 fans gathered at the late Beatle's sidewalk star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles to honor the singer-songwriter.
Civic dignitaries planned to join them at the city's Cavern Walks shopping precinct - on the ite of the legendary Cavern Club where the group was discovered.
