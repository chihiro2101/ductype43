Hurricane Gilbert battered the resorts of the Yucatan Peninsula today with 160 mph winds and torrential rains.
Thousands of people fled coastal areas for shelters inland.
``The wind was blowing out windows everywhere'' in Cancun, an official said of the resort where thousands of Americans vacation each year.
Residents along the gulf coast of Texas, 560 miles to the north, stockpiled food and supplies and prepared to evacuate.
Robert Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Florida, said early today he expects Gilbert to make landfall on the Texas-Louisiana coast in 48 to 60 hours.
The hurricane, one of the strongest in history, is ``extremely dangerous,'' the U.S. National Weather Service said.
Oil companies evacuated thousands of workers from rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, according to reports from New Orleans.
Gilbert, which has killed at least 11 people, moved over the island of Cozumel at 10 a.m. EDT, said Jose Pereira, a spokesman for the governor's office in Merida, capital of Yucatan state.
Pereira, who spoke by telephone from Mexico City, said heavy rain was falling over the peninsula and communications with Cancun and Cozumel were out.
Cancun is 240 miles east of Medira.
The National Weather Service in Miami said the eye of the storm was over northeast Yucatan at noon EDT.
High winds also were reported in Valladolid, a city of 80,000 located 80 miles southwest of Cancun, said Jose Joaquin Martil, local Red Cross president.
The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure.
