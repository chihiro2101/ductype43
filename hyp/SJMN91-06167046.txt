Mount Pinatubo rumbled today with explosions that hurled ash and gas more than 12 miles high, and a typhoon brought heavy rain that could unleash tons of debris from the jagged slopes.
Seven explosions were recorded from the 4,800-foot tropical volcano today, and scientists said more were expected.
Typhoon Yunya, packing 80 mph winds, slammed into the eastern coast of Luzon island, which includes Mount Pinatubo, early in the day.
But it quickly weakened to a tropical storm with 60 mph winds by the time it was centered about 70 miles east of the volcano.
Meanwhile, President Corazon Aquino dismissed a British newspaper report that Americans had warned her of possible radioactive contamination if the volcano damages nuclear storage sites at Clark Air Base, abandoned Monday by nearly 15,000 Americans.
The U.S. military began flying home hundreds of the 28,000 Americans who crowded onto Subic Bay Naval Base as a bizarre tropical blizzard of thick volcanic ash caused power failures across the base Friday during a third day of increasingly violent eruptions of Mount Pinatubo.
At Subic, base spokesman Robert Coble said generators had to be shut down from time to time to clean out volcanic ash, plunging the base into darkness.
Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology, said Friday's blasts were part of a single eruption, the largest since Mount Pinatubo awoke Sunday from its 600-year slumber.
Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus also said the eruption should have no effect on talks on the future of Clark and Subic, where leases expire Sept. 16.
