The scarred battleship Iowa made a somber return Sunday to its home port, where about 3,000 family members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an explosion that killed 47 sailors.
Sailors in whites with black arm bands lined the rails as the huge vessel docked at the Norfolk Naval Base's Pier 5.
Twenty minutes later, families started filing aboard the ship, exchanging tearful embraces with the returning sailors.
The explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret, which extends six decks down into the ship.
Two of the surviving crewmen of No. 2 turret stood on top of the fire-blackened turret as the ship pulled into the pier, with full crews on the ship's two other turrets.
When the vessel first appeared there were scattered cheers among those on the dock, but all remained silent as the ship pulled into the pier.
Adm. Powell F. Carter, commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet, was there to greet the vessel.
"Our faith helps us to handle what science cannot answer, the mystery of death."
The Iowa and its sister ships, the Missouri, New Jersey and Wisconsin, were commissioned during World War II and mothballed after the Korean War.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Sunday that he believes the four battleships still "have merit" as weapons in the U.S. arsenal and have a future in the modern Navy.
