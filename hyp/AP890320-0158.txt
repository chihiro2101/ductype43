Andrei D. Sakharov urged members of the Academy of Sciences on Monday to reject the leadership's list of candidates for the new Soviet legislature, which does not include the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
The 67-year-old nuclear physicist and human rights activist, who won the Nobel in 1975, said in a speech to the academy that many scientists objected to the slate for Sunday's election approved by the leadership in January.
Sakharov and several other well-known proponents of reform are missing from the list.
He called for reversal of what he called the anti-democratic decision, which produced a list of what critics describe as old-guard managers of scientific institutions.
Sakharov was nominated from several geographic districts for a seat in the new 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies, but he decided to refuse the nominations and fight for an Academy of Sciences seat.
Under an election law approved in December, 750 seats in the legislature are reserved for the Communist Party and its affiliates and for professional, social and trade union organizations.
