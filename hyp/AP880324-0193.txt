Communism suffered its first Big Mac attack Thursday as McDonald's opened a restaurant in Yugoslavia, and police were called in to keep customers who lined up for hours from getting too unruly under the golden arches.
``I just wanted to taste genuine American hamburgers,'' said Milica Nikolic, a high school student who waited for three hours to taste her first Big Mac.
People curiously examined the renovated restaurant's plush interior and the back-lit signs depicting the hamburgers, french fries, milk shakes and other fare more familiar in the West.
It also featured amber-colored tables and floors, pastel-colored upholstery, modern art paintings and discreet illumination.
``I think this restaurant has no competition in Belgrade,'' said Milica Danic, a housewife who treated her son to a cheeseburger.
``In fact, this is a clash between the Big Mac and Pljeskavica,'' said Vesna Milosevic, an official of Genex, a Yugoslav state-run enterprise that has contracted a joint venture agreement with McDonald's.
``Our aim is not to destroy the Pljeskavica on the Yugoslav market,'' said Predrag Dostanic, managing director of the Genex-McDonald's.
