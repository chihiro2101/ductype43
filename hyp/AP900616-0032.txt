Cement blocks were all that remained of homes, fallen branches stood where trees used to be and muddy streams meandered through the outskirts of this Ohio River town after a furious flash flood.
The shock had not worn off, said police officer Bruce Fink, whose bristly face bore signs of more than 20 hours on duty, including work at a temporary morgue set up at a funeral home.
Allan Hans called the flooding ``the devil's work.''
John and Sue Wright, whose home rests on the banks of Pipe Creek, estimated they lost about $20,000 worth of property.
People moved rubble and made makeshift repairs to bridges that span McMann Creek, which links homes to Ohio Route 147.
At least 170 members of the Ohio National Guard were called in to patrol and to help rebuild flood-swept roads, said Stacie Gilg, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Emergency Management Agency.
By Friday night, traffic jammed Ohio Route 7, which skirts the Ohio River and is the main north-south road through town.
Belmont County Sheriff Tom McCort said he suspected many of the vehicles belonged to sightseers.
One young man turned in a strongbox filled with valuable coins lost in the flood, the sheriff said.
