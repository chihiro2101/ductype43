The image of a dour, shoeless English boy and his absent, carefree mother prompted Julia Baird and Geoffrey Giuliano to collaborate on a book.
The boy is the public image of young John Lennon, Baird's half-brother and Giuliano's idol.
_ who was also Baird's mother
``That woman laughing, singing, dancing, saying goodbye to John, and John standing there alone crying `Mummy, Mummy!'
Published in North America last fall, ``John Lennon, My Brother'' was co-authored by Giuliano, a Beatles aficionado who lives in this Erie Canal city about 25 miles north of Buffalo.
The two-year, cross-Atlantic collaboration came from two different motives.
Baird disagrees with other biographies which say that after his father decamped and Julia turned her son over to her sister, Mimi, Lennon was a grim youth who felt abandoned by his mother.
The book got its start after Baird watched a British television special in 1985 marking the fifth anniversary of Lennon's murder.
Then she met Giuliano, who was in Liverpool to promote his first book, ``The Beatles: A Celebration.''
Giuliano, 35, a self-proclaimed huckster, convinced Baird to work with him on a book, which he pieced together from interviews with Baird in England.
While proofreading the text, Baird sent a copy to McCartney.
With a collection of rare early photos, the book is more a family album than a biography.
``I could have cashed in when John was alive,'' Baird said.
``When John died the tabloids in England were knocking on the door saying, `Write your story, name your price.'
Also shown the door was Albert Goldman, whose sordid biography, ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' hit bookstores about the same time as Baird's book.
Baird, who read Goldman's scathing biography of Elvis Presley, said she turned down an interview with Goldman, who brands Lennon homosexual, anorexic and possibly a murderer.
