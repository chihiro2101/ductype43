Thousands of grieving friends and relatives of the fallen 47 crewmen from the battleship USS Iowa gathered quietly Monday and heard President Bush praise their loved ones as ``brothers in eternity.''
``We join today in mourning for the 47 who perished, and in fact, for the 11 who survived,'' the president told a packed memorial service at Norfolk Naval Air Station.
``They all were, in the words of a poet, `the men behind the guns.'
``They came from Hidalgo, Texas; Cleveland, Ohio; Tampa, Florida; Costa Mesa, California.
The president, a World War II Navy pilot, said he was proud to recommission the Iowa in 1984 and said it had earned 11 battle stars in two wars.
But with the still-unexplained fire and explosion last Wednesday in the battleship's No. 2 gun turret, he said, ``Fate has written a sorrowful chapter in the history of this great ship.''
Fred P. Moosally, said the turret's crew was the best gun crew on the ship, and called its chief _ Chief Gunner's Mate Reginald Owen Ziegler of Port Gibson, N.Y.
As many as 500 Iowa crewmen were unable to attend the service because they were delayed by traffic and were not permitted to enter the hangar because of security measures to protect Bush.
Moosally told the crowd of mourners that he remembered the men of turret No. 2.
The men of Turret Two will be part of the spirit of the Iowa forever.''
``Our extensive training paid off,'' he said.
``Besides the firefighting crews, we had cooks, engineers, deck seamen, Marines all fighting to save the ship.''
Moosally said.
All but 11 men in the huge gun turret died almost instantly last Wednesday when the explosion ripped through it.
John P. Morse, the Iowa's weapons officer, said the guns were thoroughly inspected the morning of the accident, and Moosally said he had no hesitation about the guns' safety.
