A biography that portrays John Lennon as a drug-addled, anorexic bisexual who raged his way from Liverpool to New York City is ``totally fiction,''
Yoko Ono said in a national radio broadcast.
``It's amazing that somebody took such a poetic license.
The usually reclusive Ono agreed to the interview to counter Goldman's ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' which presents the ex-Beatle as a violent, drug-addicted drunk who wanted to dump his wife.
As for Ono, Goldman shows her as a gold-digger who snorted heroin up to the time of Lennon's death.
Goldman also charges she was responsible for Paul McCartney's 1980 marijuana bust in Japan, had affairs while they were married and was just as intent on a divorce as Lennon.
``It's totally fiction,'' Yoko said during the hour-long program, which opened with Lennon's song, ``Gimme Some Truth,'' and coincided with the book's national release Wednesday.
Ono was interviewed by longtime associate Elliot Mintz, who is described in Goldman's book as a spy for Yoko _ a charge Mintz denied during the show.
