Time ran out for the U.S. athletes when the Winter Olympics ended Sunday, with a team headed by Brent Rushlaw a tick away from a U.S. bobsled medal and Dutch speed skater Yvonne van Gennip a triple gold medalist with time to spare.
The best America could do was six medals, its worst Winter Games showing in 52 years.
Two of the six were gold medals, won by Brian Boitano in figure skating and Bonnie Blair in speed skating.
The 250 figure skaters who performed included past and present medal winners as well as young skaters from Albertville, France, site of the 1992 Winter Games, and Seoul, South Korea, site of this year's summer Games.
Four other teams also bested the United States in terms of overall medals: Austria, West Germany, Finland and the Netherlands.
