Private groups and officials from Tokyo to London to Charleston, S.C., offered help to the ruptured San Francisco Bay area, but some said relief for the earthquake could drain coffers already strained by previous disasters.
Los Angeles, long San Francisco's West Coast competitor but equally at the mercy of the San Andreas Fault, quickly shipped doctors, sonic equipment and fire investigators to the Bay Area.
The mayor of a sister city in disaster, Charleston's Joseph P. Riley Jr., sent a plane load of drinking water, a symbolic return of the support his city got after Hugo.
``I know we still have and will have great needs here and charity certainly begins at home,'' Riley said.
``However, it would be wrong for this community ... not to reach in (our pockets) and contribute to those who are hurt and suffering right now.''
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos has estimated damage $2 billion in his city alone.
The Salvation Army had the food cooking almost before the earth quit shaking in Northern California, while the Red Cross opened the doors and unfolded cots in 25 shelters.
A team of British engineers were to fly to San Francisco today to help assess structural damage from the quake.
Coast Guard offices across the West Coast provided San Francisco with as many boats and helicopters as could be spared, said Coast Guard spokeswoman Elizabeth Neely.
