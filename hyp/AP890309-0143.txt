The Democratic-controlled Senate today rejected the nomination of former Texas Sen. John Tower as defense secretary, delivering a major rebuke to President Bush just 49 days into his term.
The Senate's 53-47 vote came after a bitter and divisive debate focused on Tower's drinking habits, behavior toward women and his business dealings with defense contractors.
It was only the ninth time in 200 years that the Senate has voted to reject a president's Cabinet choice and the only time it has done so early in a new administration.
Vice President Dan Quayle presided over the Senate during the roll call, underscoring Bush's commitment to the nominee.
``The nomination of John Tower to be secretary of defense is not confirmed,'' Quayle intoned after the vote.
Kansas GOP Sen. Nancy Kassebaum provided the biggest surprise of the final hours of debate when she became the sole Republican to declare her opposition.
Tower's Republican defenders began to speak of him in the past tense and the nominee also appeared to accept defeat, even before the roll was called.
``Just moments ago I took a call from John Tower,'' said Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the senior GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
``He asked me to convey thanks _ in his words _ to the troops who rallied to his support.''
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, moved to repair damage caused by the bitter struggle to relations between the Senate and President Bush.
Dole agreed to a late-afternoon vote on the nomination after acknowledging the collapse of a last-minute bid to give Tower an extraordinary six-month trial period as defense secretary to prove he could abstain from drinking.
Names most frequently mentioned in White House speculation as a replacement for Tower if his nomination failed are Sen. Warner, a former secretary of the Navy; former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld; former Rep. Jack Edwards, R-Ala.; and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft.
