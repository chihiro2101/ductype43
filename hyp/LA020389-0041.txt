President Bush has decided to nominate John D. Negroponte, a veteran diplomat who helped direct U.S. aid to Nicaraguan rebels, to the key position of ambassador to Mexico, Administration officials said Thursday.
Negroponte, a 28-year Foreign Service veteran, served as U.S. ambassador to Honduras from 1981 through 1985, when the CIA was secretly funding the Contras.
Mexico's leftist opposition party already has criticized the appointment, which has not been formally announced.
But Bush Administration officials said they are confident that the Mexican government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will accept the nomination.
Meanwhile, Bush's choice as assistant secretary of state for Latin America, Democratic political consultant Bernard Aronson, ran into objections from several Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, congressional aides said.
The two senior Republicans on the panel, Sens. Jesse Helms (R-N. C.) and Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), both expressed concern about Aronson's appointment to Secretary of State James A. Baker III, the aides said.
