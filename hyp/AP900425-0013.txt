Already they're saying it's the biggest happening in astronomy since Galileo put his eye to a telescope.
So, step right up folks, and discover the wonders of the universe.
Look at light created 14 billion years ago and arriving at your eye only this instant.
Ride along to the beginning of everything, almost, to the Big Bang of 10 or 20 thousand million years ago.
Watch galaxies form.
Follow the flow of gas into the Milky Way's halo.
``In the history of optical astronomy there have been two great leaps in the resolution of the universe: Galileo's telescope in the autumn of 1609, and the Hubble Space Telescope in April 1990.''
``No one ever made anything that good,''
With the Hubble, says scientist Edward Weiler, such pictures are possible any time we want.
