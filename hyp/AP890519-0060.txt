President Corazon Aquino said today she will not allow Ferdinand Marcos to come home to die and her government will not permit the ousted president to be buried on Philippine soil.
Marcos' wife Imelda appealed today to Mrs. Aquino to ``open her heart'' and allow the former president to return.
Marcos' lawyer also asked the Philippine Supreme Court to order the return, pledging the ousted leader would cooperate with the Aquino administration.
Marcos was reported in critical condition today in a Honolulu hospital after undergoing emergency kidney surgery.
In Honolulu, Marcos aide Arturo Aruiza said Imelda had left the hospital to make a final appeal to Mrs. Aquino to allow her husband to die in his homeland.
Mrs. Aquino told reporters earlier that she was sorry to hear that Marcos' condition had deteriorated ``and I pray that he will be able to recover.''
