The Soviet Union said today that a united Germany can join NATO after a five-year transition period during which all Soviet and U.S. troops would leave the country.
The United States rejected the proposal, a U.S. official said.
The proposal was outlined by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze during international talks in East Berlin on the strategic future of a united Germany.
The remarks, a copy of which were obtained by The Associated Press, indicates that a united Germany would be free to join the Western NATO alliance after a five-year transitional period.
Shevardnadze made the proposal as he met with U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and their counterparts from Britain, France and the two German states.
The United States wants a united Germany to be a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Soviet Union has been staunchly opposed.
