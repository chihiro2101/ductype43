Police bulldozed unstable brick and mud houses today while those left homeless by an earthquake that killed at least 749 people sought shelter and awaited government aid.
Casualty reports continued to trickle in from remote parts of this Himalayan mountain kingdom as relief workers fanned out through the foothills and valleys.
Sunday's pre-dawn quake struck near the India-Nepal border.
At least 549 people were killed in Nepal, said Tek Bahadur Thapa of the Home Affairs Ministry.
They put the India death count at anywhere from 400 to 1,500.
Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha visited Dharan on Tuesday and surveyed heaps of bricks that were once three-story and five-story houses.
Police Inspector G. Adhikari said bulldozers have demolished more than 50 houses deemed too dangerous for habitation.
Adhikari said local officials had not yet heard from the government on compensation or new housing for people whose homes were demolished.
