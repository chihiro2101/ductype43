The 16-inch guns on the USS Iowa, which can lob a shell the weight of a Volkswagen 23 miles, have an outdated design that is unfit in the nuclear missile age, critics say.
They all ought to be eliminated,'' retired Rear Adm. Eugene LaRocque of the Center for Defense Information said Thursday.
``I don't know what more it takes to get people to recognize this ancient technology is no longer appropriate on warships.''
But the Navy defended the 16-inch gun, the mightiest in use on any ocean, after an explosion killed 47 sailors Wednesday aboard the battleship Iowa while a turret crew loaded gunpowder for target practice.
``This gun ... remains the finest naval gun in the world.
It was the pinnacle of gun design art, and it is still a front-line system,'' said Capt.
The main criticism is that the big gun requires gunpowder packed in silk bags to fire 16-inch-diameter shells from its 62-foot-long barrel.
It works like the breech-loaded guns that roared during the Civil War: A shell is placed into a barrel and then charged with gunpowder in a separate package.
Missiles, the backbone of the modern Navy's attack capability, have integrated propellants.
The Navy said Thursday that none of the guns in the Iowa turret had been fired before the explosion took place.
They were upgraded with Tomahawk cruise missiles, 20mm guns and Harpoon missiles.
