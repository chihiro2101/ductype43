Soldiers from three nations locked the doors of Checkpoint Charlie today and a crane whisked away the Cold War relic that symbolized a divided world.
A U.S. Army band played a stirring song about old Berlin as the rectangular white sentry station, a place East Germans died trying to reach, was hoisted onto a truck for its passage into history.
The famed Allied checkpoint by the Berlin Wall was closed with an elaborate ceremony that brought together the top diplomats from the Germanys and the four World War II Allies.
``For 29 years Checkpoint Charlie embodied the Cold War,'' U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III told a crowd of invited guests and journalists on Berlin's Friedrich Street.
Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and the foreign ministers from France, Britain and the two Germanys each heralded the end of the checkpoint as a symbol of change.
Shevardnadze called for the removal of Berlin's status as an Allied-controlled city and the withdrawal of troops within six months after the two German states unify, which could come in December.
The German and Allied foreign ministers are meeting in East Berlin to discuss the status of the city and a united Germany's role in world affairs.
Large sections of the Berlin Wall are being dismantled daily, and U.S. officials decided to time the removal of Checkpoint Charlie with the foreign ministers' meeting.
He was shot in the neck.''
