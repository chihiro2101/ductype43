Historians say the world need not fear that German jackboots will echo again on European pavements, but some still see the rush toward German reunification as a setback _ a step away from the integration of Europe.
For the most part, the historians say an East Germany collapsing into chaos represents a greater threat to stability than a united German state.
He was one of several experts in German history discussing the implications of reunification following the decision Tuesday by the four World War II allies _ the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union _ to accept the reunification of a Germany they divided 45 years ago.
University of Chicago historian Michael Geyer, a native of Germany, said he feared the creation of a ``strong, sovereign nation in the center of Europe'' could reverse a more important development _ the 40-year drive toward an integrated Europe in which industries, banks, trade unions and even government ministries have been collaborating across borders.
``The East German state is collapsing,'' said Geyer.
``If I had my druthers reunifications would have happened after 1992, after the integration of the West German economy into the economy of Western Europe,'' said Charles J. Herber of George Washington University, expressing similar concern.
For all that, Breitman said, ``One Germany is not only inevitable, but given the successful record of West Germany over the last 40 years, my feeling is it is better than having a regime in chaos.''
While the people of West Europe have gotten over nationalistic distrusts, East Europeans, living in closed societies, have not, he said, and fear of Germany is a reality in East Europe and Russia, he said.
Gordon Craig, emeritus professor at Stanford, said the division of Germany has been the basis of a peace settlement ``which worked pretty well'' but was ``abnormal and sooner or later had to be corrected.''
