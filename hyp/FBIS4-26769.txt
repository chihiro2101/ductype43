[Text] Beijing, June 26 (XINHUA) -- Floods have all receded along Xijiang, Beijiang, Xiangjiang and Ganjiang except at a section of the Xijiang River in Wuzhou city, Guangxi, a spokesman from the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters announced today.
The spokesman attributed the falling water level to the major water conservancy projects which help to mitigate losses.
Meanwhile, he said, tension has been eased in the Pearl River delta as the latest tropical storm has been weakened after landing in Yangjiang city, Guangdong Province.
Meanwhile, 740 million yuan in loans and another 50 million yuan in donations have also been sent to flooded areas in Guangdong Province.
