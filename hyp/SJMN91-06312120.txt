TO MOST PEOPLE, marathons and vacations are mutually exclusive.
Vacation, according to Webster, means "freedom from any activity
respite."
"Skiers have mountain ranges, tennis players have resorts, why can't a runner take a marathon vacation?" said Thorn Gilligan, president of Marathon Tours in Boston.
Gilligan took 5,500 people last year on 20 tours to countries from Bermuda to Moscow.
Qualifying times are not required.
London, the most popular European city to visit, holds the world's largest marathon (April 12 next year).
"Most marathons take you through cities, so you get a chance to see things you'd never see on a sightseeing bus," said Fred Lebow, president of the New York Roadrunner's Club and director of the New York Marathon.
"Each city has something unique."
The price includes round-trip air fare, four days and three nights at the Grotto Bay Beach hotel (per person, based on double occupancy), full breakfasts and dinners, a welcome cocktail party and post-race parties and discounts.
England has similar organizations: Sports Tours International and Keith Prowse, a company that specializes in British theater, sports and concert tours.
There are also trips that incorporate running into the sightseeing schedule.
Running 26 miles just to see a city definitely isn't for everyone, but at the very least, it's a way to kill two birds with one stone.
