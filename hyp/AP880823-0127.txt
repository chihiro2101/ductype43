Police bulldozed teetering houses Tuesday to keep people from returning to homes left unsafe by an earthquake that killed at least 731 people in India and Nepal.
Officials in both countries expected the death toll to rise as relief workers reached remote towns that have been inaccessible since Sunday's devastating quake.
Some roads were flooded by heavy rains that continued Tuesday, while others had 3-foot-deep cracks or were blocked by boulders the size of houses in the Himalayan mountains and valleys.
At least 531 people were killed in Nepal, said Tek Bahadur Thapa, additional secretary in the Home Affairs Ministry.
Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha visited Dharan, one of the hardest-hit towns, and surveyed heaps of bricks that were once three-story and five-story houses.
``This is the biggest calamity to strike Nepal,'' Shrestha said as he toured the town.
In Darbhanga, India on Tuesday, worshipers offered sweets, milk and coconuts to appease the Hindu god of destruction.
The earthquake, which struck shortly before daybreak Sunday when most people were still asleep, registered 6.5 on the Richter scale.
Police Inspector G. Adhikari said bulldozers have demolished more than 50 houses deemed too dangerous for habitation.
Rescuers in army helicopters searched for survivors in Bihar's Darbhanga, Madhubani and Mungar districts.
