Two corporate executives sat down in an office here last month to talk business with a bunch of clowns.
The subject was no laughing matter, but rather the serious endeavor of finding South Korea's Ronald McDonald.
Seven years after the U.S. hamburger giant first tried to bring its Big Macs to South Korea, the golden arches were finally going up.
McAhn Industries Ltd. recently opened the first of what it expects will be a string of burger outlets in Seoul.
The company is a 50-50 joint venture of McDonald's Corp., Oak Brook, Ill., and an accountant-turned-entrepreneur, Ahn Hyo Young.
The business is likely to profit from the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul in September, and from an anticipated post-Olympic economic boom here.
The competition, besides Wendy's International's 11 shops and six of Burger King, a unit of Pillsbury Co., includes home-grown burger chains.
McDonald's strategy is to take things slowly, avoiding extravagances, Mr. Ahn and Awad Sifri, McDonald's marketing director, say.
