Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers.
New York-based American International Group Inc. expects net losses related to Hugo to reduce pretax earnings between $35 million and $45 million.
AIG insured property in Puerto Rico, the eastern Caribbean Islands and the coastal regions of the Carolinas.
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. said its State Fire &amp; Casualty Co. unit estimates claim payments from Hugo will exceed $400 million in South Carolina alone, far surpassing the company's record payout for a single disaster.
