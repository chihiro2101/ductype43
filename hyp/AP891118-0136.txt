Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice President Dan Quayle, praised the heroism of this tornado-ravaged northern Alabama city's residents during a visit Saturday.
Mrs. Quayle personally thanked workers cleaning up the debris left by Wednesday's twister and visited some of the injured at Crestwood Hospital during her 2{-hour tour.
``The community is filled with heroes _ people who without ... regard to their own personal danger helped other citizens so that they could survive,'' said Mrs. Quayle, who was accompanied by Gov. Guy Hunt and U.S. Sens.
Mrs. Quayle, who made similar visits to San Francisco after the Oct. 17 earthquake and Charleston, S.C., after Hurricane Hugo, also praised corporations that have made donations to help Huntsville recover.
``We're here to get the job done,'' Grant Peterson, associate director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Friday.
``Any one disaster like Hugo or the earthquake in California exceeds ... what we have in a normal year alone,'' Peterson said.
Congress provided $1.1 billion in supplemental funds to FEMA after Hugo devastated the Caribbean and the East Coast in September, and $1.2 billion following the earthquake that ravaged parts of northern California on Oct. 17.
Peterson and his aides urged patience during the arduous task of processing thousands of relief requests from the Huntsville area.
``I'll make sure that we expedite these requests to meet the people's needs.''
The state will have to ante up 25 percent of the cost of providing clothing and temporary housing for tornado victims, with the federal government pitching in the other 75 percent.
Hunt stressed that government agencies won't be able to shoulder the entire load.
``It's heartwarming to see how people have come together.''
