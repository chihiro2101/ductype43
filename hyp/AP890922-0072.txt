Amid the uproar of live coverage by the major networks and scores of other media organizations, National Hurricane Center forecasters went about their business of monitoring Hurricane Hugo.
``The whole system looks chaotic, but it works,'' said Bob Sheets, the center's director.
On one side of a large room dominated by a U-shaped bank of monitoring equipment were the forecasters, making meticulous calculations about where the deadly hurricane will strike and getting emergency operations going in those areas.
On the other side were the media _ a pack of reporters, camera operators and technicians, jockeying for seconds of Sheets' time and tidbits of his expertise.
``We obviously don't like this and could probably do a better job, but everyone knows now because of the media,'' said hurricane specialist Max Mayfield.
But, he warned, the hurricane center still is following three other weather systems that have moved into the Atlantic between the United States and Africa, and another storm in the Pacific.
