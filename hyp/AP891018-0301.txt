Most San Francisco-area homeowners may have to pay for damage from Tuesday's earthquake out of their own pockets, while insurance companies may reap long-term benefits from higher rates, industry spokesmen and analysts said Wednesday.
Only 15 percent to 20 percent of California homeowners have earthquake insurance, which typically requires a 10 percent deductible and costs between $200 to $400 a year for a $100,000 home, according to industry spokesmen.
The Association of California Insurance Cos. in Sacramento said that in the San Francisco area roughly 25 to 30 percent of the homes have earthquake insurance.
Insured homeowners without earthquake protection will get reimbursed only if their homes were ravaged by fire, which is covered under basic homeowner insurance polices, said Hugh Strawn, director of catastrophe services at the Property Loss Research Bureau in Schaumburg, Ill.
Insurance companies attempted Wednesday to assess the amount of quake-related damages they're likely to have to pay.
In addition to home damage, the companies likely will get claims for automobile damage, broken glass, theft and burglary, business interruption due to electrical outages, water damage and, possibly, workers compensation.
``We don't think any company is going to have problems paying claims,'' said Elisa Siegal, public affairs manager for the American Insurance Association, a Washington-based trade group.
``It's going to be a meaningful loss, perhaps as big as Hugo,'' said Robert Glasspiegel, an analyst with Hartford-based Langen McAlenney.
