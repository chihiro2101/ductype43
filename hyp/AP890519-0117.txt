President Corazon Aquino on Friday refused to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return home to die and said her government won't permit him to be buried here despite ``a last appeal'' from his wife.
The 71-year-old Marcos was in critical condition Friday in a Honolulu hospital after emergency kidney surgery.
Marcos' wife, Imelda, broadcast an appeal Friday to Mrs. Aquino to allow her husband to die in his homeland, and his supporters threatened mass protests if the request is rejected.
But Mrs. Aquino refused to withdraw her ban on Marcos, and the Philippine Supreme Court rejected a petition from the former president's lawyer, Juan David, to order the return.
``I would like first of all to convey to the family of Mr. Marcos that I do pray that he will still recover from this latest critical illness,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
``I regret very much it is not possible for us to allow him to return.''
In a statement broadcast by a pro-Marcos radio station, Mrs. Marcos said she has tried to telephone Mrs. Aquino from Hawaii but was told the president was busy.
