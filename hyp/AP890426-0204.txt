Actor Gale Gordon, a sidekick of Lucille Ball from radio days who appeared with her in three television series, recalled on Wednesday how the comedian never thought of herself as particularly funny.
``Oh, but when she told a story or recalled an event that happened she always illustrated it with her body and her face,'' the 83-year-old Gordon said in a telephone interview.
Gordon, who is appearing in a play in Edmonton, spent the day in an Edmonton hotel room, mourning the death of Lucille Ball in a Los Angeles hospital Wednesday at age 77 and quietly remembering his funny friend.
``The world will miss her greatly,'' the actor said.
In his first television series alongside Miss Ball, Gordon was the flustered banker Mr. Mooney in ``The Lucy Show'' from 1962-68.
Gordon first met Miss Ball in 1947 on the radio program ``My Favorite Husband,'' which later became ``I Love Lucy'' on television.
