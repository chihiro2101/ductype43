Within hours of the schoolyard shootings that left five children and the gunman dead and 30 wounded Tuesday, dozens of translators rushed to assist the many Southeast Asian parents who arrived at the hospital desperate for word of their youngsters.
They are not sure what happened, not sure what's going on around them,'' said Laura Dixon, of the Charterhouse Center refugee program, in Stockton, describing the scene translators found when they arrived at San Joaquin County General Hospital.
``They do have people on staff at the hospital, but they are so overloaded they need every extra person they can secure,'' said Dixon, whose organization began calling throughout Stockton for volunteers speaking Southeast Asian languages.
The San Joaquin County Mental Health Department told Dixon a grief center might be established at Charterhouse to help survivors, whose recovery will be complicated by the language barrier.
