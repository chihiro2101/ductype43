Trucks carried aid into earthquake-stricken Iran on Saturday from Soviet Azerbaijan, which observed a day of mourning for victims, the official Tass news agency said.
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent his condolences to the Iranian leadership, and the Soviet Red Cross dispatched a plane carrying rescue workers and aid.
In his message to Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, Gorbachev expressed his "deep condolences to the families and friends of those who lost their lives in the earthquake."
A column of trucks carrying 100 doctors, 10,000 tons of food, clothing and equipment such as welding gear left the town of Nakhicheva near the border.
Tass said people in Azerbaijan, many of whom are Shiite Muslims who feel a kinship with people of their faith in Iran, poured money into a public fund for earthquake victims.
Other assistance reportedly was due from Holland, Turkey, Greece, Pakistan, Belgium, Finland, India, Bangladesh, Yugoslavia, Sri Lanka, Kuwait and several other nations.
