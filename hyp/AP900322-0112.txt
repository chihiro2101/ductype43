A drug that eases the heart's workload can cut the risk of new cardiac attacks and death by 20 percent in people recovering from heart attacks, according to a major study released Thursday.
The study, conducted in Denmark, found that the drug Verapamil, known as a calcium channel blocker, was effective for the 1{ years after a heart attack.
Calcium blockers are among several classes of medicines commonly prescribed to relieve high blood pressure.
``This is the first trial that indicates that a calcium blocker may be beneficial after an acute myocardial infarction,'' or heart attack, said Dr. Carl J. Pepine of the University of Florida.
Many patients do not tolerate beta blockers,'' said Dr. Kresten Mellemgaard of Central County Hospital in Hillerod, Denmark, a co-author of the study.
In the study, conducted at 20 community hospitals, doctors compared 897 patients who got Verapamil after heart attacks with 878 people who took placebos.
``We wanted to see if an effect would be observed with Verapamil,'' said Dr. Forgen Fischer Hansen of Copenhagen Municipal Hospital.
They said they were unsure why earlier studies failed to show any benefit from calcium blockers after heart attacks.
