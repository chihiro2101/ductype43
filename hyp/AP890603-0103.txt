Chinese troops stormed Tiananmen Square early Sunday, shooting and beating their way through crowds of pro-democracy protesters in clashes that witnesses and doctors said killed at least 32 people.
The troops cut a violent swath through the heart of Beijing to get to the the square, rolling through barricades and surging masses on the surrounding streets.
By 3:30 a.m., soldiers and riot police had surrounded Tiananmen, boxing off several thousand students and supporters concentrated around a monument to revolutionary heroes in the center.
``You have to give up all hope,'' students said over their loudspeaker at the monument.
The death and casualty toll was believed to be mounting rapidly.
One man was seen shot in the back, another in the head.
Ho Te-chien, a Taiwanese singer who defected to China in 1983 and has been active in the student movement, urged the students to leave.
A 33-foot-high replica of the Statue of Liberty, set up by students last week, remained standing.
The assault came two weeks after Premier Li Peng declared martial law in Beijing and sent troops to the city.
In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Saturday the situation in China had become ``ugly and chaotic.
``This will disturb the United States government, and will disturb the American people, considerably,'' he said.
Students threw Molotov cocktails and other objects at them.
