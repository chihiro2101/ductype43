Investigators aboard the USS Iowa searched for clues to the cause of a fiery explosion that claimed the lives of 47 sailors as the damaged battleship headed home and grief-stricken families dealt with the loss of their loved ones.
Officials refused to speculate publicly on what caused the worst disaster to strike a Navy ship in more than a decade, a blast that ripped through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret during naval exercises Wednesday in the Atlantic north of Puerto Rico.
Although naval gunnery experts combed the vessel Thursday, their task was complicated by the absence of survivors from the swiveling gun housing where the explosion occurred.
Eleven men escaped from powder magazines located deep within the ship at the base of the turret.
``We have no eyewitnesses to what actually transpired,'' Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told reporters as he returned to Washington from a NATO meeting in Brussels.
The Navy imposed a moratorium on firing 16-inch guns found on the Iowa and its three sister battleships, the New Jersey, the Wisconsin and the Missouri, pending an investigation of the disaster.
As the Iowa headed toward its home port in Norfolk, Va., the flag-draped, metal coffins containing the bodies of the 47 seamen killed arrived at the Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, site of the largest military mortuary.
``It's the greatest tragedy any of us can suffer,'' said Rear Adm. Jimmy Pappas, the base commander in Norfolk.
