The most intense hurricane on record surged toward Texas today after battering the Yucatan Peninsula with 160 mph winds, leveling slums, pummeling posh resorts and forcing tens of thousands to flee.
Hurricane Gilbert, which has left nearly one in four Jamaicans homeless, slackened somewhat as it swirled over land, but the storm was beginning to gain strength over open water as it moved toward the U.S. Gulf Coast with sustained winds of 120 mph.
The storm was headed west northwest, said National Hurricane Center director Bob Sheets.
It was moving at 15 mph and dumping up to 10 inches of rain.
``The area that we have the most likely possibility that this hurricane will make landfall is in the northern part of Mexico or the southeastern, southern part of Texas,'' he said.
Earlier this week the storm struck the Carribean, ravaging Jamaica, the Dominican Repubic, the Cayman Islands and Haiti, killing at least 19 in Jamaica and five in the Dominican Republic.
Gilbert battered the provincial capital of Merida and the gulf port cities of Puerto Progreso, Campeche and Ciudad del Carmen, closing airports and roads and knocking out communications and power and innundating streets and highways.
The ministry said the storm seriously damaged the luxury hotel zone in the resort of Cancun and destroyed about a quarter of the homes on the nearby island of Cozumel.
A navy spokesman in Mexico City said he had no word on the plight of an estimated 15,000 people stranded there.
In Campeche, boats were driven onto the street running along the waterfront, Ramon Castillo, a night watchman at the newspaper Novedades of Campeche, said in a telephone interview.
Sheets said the hurricane was expected to hit land midday Friday and that its sustained winds would today ``certainly increase to 130, 140 miles per hour.''
U.S. consular officials said they did not know how many tourists were in Cancun, which receives about 50,000 visitors per month.
