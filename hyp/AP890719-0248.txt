President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that thousands of striking coal miners and other workers are urging railway employees to join the work stoppage and that the unrest threatens his economic reforms.
In a report to the Supreme Soviet, Gorbachev said they have resulted in a 1 million-ton drop in coal production.
Following Gorbachev to the podium, legislator Anatoly Saunin said each lost work day cost millions of rubles that might otherwise help improve living conditions.
Saunin, from the Donetsk region of the Ukraine, the country's top coal region, said the number of striking mines there increased from 20 on Tuesday to 58 today.
``Now there are reports of calls to railroad workers to join the strike as of Aug. 1,'' Gorbachev said during the parliamentary session, which was broadcast on television and radio.
Gorbachev said he and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov sent a telegram to miners in the Ukraine assuring them that any concessions granted to Siberian miners would apply to other mining regions as well.
The Politburo sent to Kuznetsk Nikolai N. Slyunkov, a member of the ruling Communist Party body who worked several years in the tractor-building industry and has spoken about labor discipline.
Tass carried a report Tuesday denying that the Soviet Union's third major coal region, Karaganda in Kazakhstan, also was on strike.
A spokesman for the strike committee in Prokopyevsk, Valery Legachev, said Tuesday that Slyunkov ``promised to increase the area's regular food supplies by 20 to 30 percent, as well as soap and washing powder.''
