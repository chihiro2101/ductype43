A therapist defended her interviews of alleged victims in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, despite criticism by several jurors who said leading questions undermined the prosecution's case.
The jury on Thursday acquitted Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, of 52 child molestation counts and deadlocked on 13 other counts.
Therapist Kee McFarlane later defended her work with hundreds of McMartin students, and suggested that the goals of therapy are at odds with the legal standards required for a successful criminal prosecution.
Many of the interviews were conducted at an early stage of the sexual abuse investigation by MacFarlane, a social worker and director of the Child Sexual Abuse Center at Children's Institute International.
MacFarlane said Thursday she still believes children from the school had been molested and that they had not fabricated their accounts of abuse.
``If the CII tapes had not been entered into evidence and I had not seen them, I could have believed the children a little more,'' juror Brenda Williams said.
