Three major new eruptions rocked Mount Pinatubo late Wednesday night and early today, forcing another emergency evacuation of Clark Air Base and increasing fears of even more violent explosions from the long-dormant volcano in the days ahead.
Mudslides also threatened after fierce thunderstorms and lightning Wednesday illuminated afternoon skies eerily darkened by giant volcanic clouds.
As much as two inches of coarse gray ash and fist-sized pieces of pumice fell along a 50-mile stretch southwest of the volcano.
An eruption this morning caused an earthquake so strong it "sent seismograph needles off the chart," and registered 60 miles south in Manila, said Jessie Daligdig, a government geologist.
At times, winds whipped the grit into the air, forcing cars to use windshield wipers and headlights in blizzard-like conditions through the afternoon.
The initial explosions on Mount Pinatubo at 8:51 a.m. Wednesday sent a 10-mile-high mushroom cloud of swirling ash and rock fragments into the skies over Clark Air Base, forcing the Air Force to evacuate hundreds of American volunteers who had stayed behind to guard it and to tend sensitive communications equipment.
Most of the 16,000 Americans who live and work at Clark were evacuated Monday, when scientists said it was clear that the volcano, dormant for more than six centuries, was returning to life.
Many of the villages in the vicinity were holding Independence Day celebrations when heavy gray clouds first began raining ash Wednesday morning.
Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, said scientists could not estimate how much magma was still pent up inside Mount Pinatubo, but said more eruptions at least as violent are expected within the next three days.
