Five astronauts boarded Discovery today for a second try at sending the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to the beginning of time.
``Astronomers are starting to tingle again in anticipation of what the Hubble will be able to accomplish,'' said Lennard Fisk, head of NASA science activities.
Air Force forecasters said there was a 90 percent chance the weather would be favorable for launching the shuttle at the scheduled time of 8:31 a.m. EDT.
More than a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were pumped into the space ship's fuel tanks after midnight.
The astronauts, wearing bright orange flight suits, climbed into the crew cabin just as dawn was breaking over the Kennedy Space Center.
The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, will give astronomers ``a new set of eyes and ears that we don't have,'' said William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program.
Hubble has been waiting to take its place in space since 1983, delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.
The day after launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will use the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescope into space.
In addition to Hubble, Discovery carries a human skull filled with sensors to measure the space radiation that astronauts receive.
