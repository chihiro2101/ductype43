Sir, The argument for an independent central bank is that it should be free of party political interference, not that it should conduct monetary policy without regard to national, regional or global interests.
Whatever policy the Kohl government followed over reunification, it was bound to unleash a large federal deficit and inflationary pressures in Germany.
The governments of Europe have been remarkably patient with the Bundesbank, although it is threatening nearly 10 years of European effort for greater economic and political integration.
Yet Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, advises there are no grounds for a cut in Germany's interest rates.
