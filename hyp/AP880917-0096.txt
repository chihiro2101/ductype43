Rains from Hurricane Gilbert sent a river raging over its banks in Monterrey, sweeping at least 10 policemen to their deaths and overturning buses loaded with evacuees from Matamoros, police said today.
The flooding occurred in Monterrey, an industrial city of 3 million people, located 110 miles from the Texas border and 140 miles inland from Matamoros.
At least 10 police officers were swept away while on a rescue mission around midnight, a judicial police officer said.
The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said early today it had been raining for more than 24 hours.
A trailer truck also slid into the Santa Catarina river in the driving rain and its two occupants were missing, the local newspaper El Norte said.
Monterrey is a major northern industrial center and the capital of Nuevo Leon state.
The Santa Catarina river crosses Monterrey.
The storm slammed into Mexico for the second time in a week Friday afternoon.
The hurricane has killed at least 109 people, including one in Texas, 39 in Mexico, 26 in Jamaica, 30 in Haiti, five in the Dominican Republic and eight in Honduras.
Maximum sustained winds were estimated to be near 50 mph and the storm was expected to weaken further during the next 24 hours.
The storm was moving west-northwest at about 12 mph, and was expected to follow that track through midday today before turning gradually to the northwest, forecasters said.
