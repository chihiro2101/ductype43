The resignation of the land reform secretary raises doubts about President Corazon Aquino's commitment to agrarian reform and dramatizes conflicts in a government criticized for lack of vision.
The controversy climaxed Thursday with the resignation of Secretary-designate Florencio Abad, 35, whose nomination was opposed by the pro-Aquino Struggle of the Democratic Filipino Party.
Handling of the controversy highlighted all the inconsistencies for which Mrs. Aquino has been criticized: lack of clear priorities; tactical blundering; and the strong influence of her relatives over national policy.
It also reinforced the suspicion among liberals that for all her rhetoric, Mrs. Aquino does not share the deep commitment to social change which they expected when she took power in the 1986 ``people power'' uprising against the late Ferdinand Marcos.
Land reform, ``the centerpiece program of her administration, is dead.''
Although the deal was approved by the National Development Corp., Abad, a former congressman, said the land should be distributed to peasants under the agrarian reform program.
Lawmakers on the Commission on Appointments who belong to the pro-Aquino Struggle of the Democratic Filipino Party blocked Abad's confirmation through eight hearings until he finally resigned.
The Manila press transformed Abad into a folk hero, depicting him as the champion of the farmer against political barons of the Struggle of the Democratic Filipino Party, dubbed ``Landlord-Dominated Party.''
``There is no way Cory Aquino will challenge Peping,'' said one Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Rather than break up the estate, they used a legal option and created a ``profit-sharing'' plan for the tenants.
