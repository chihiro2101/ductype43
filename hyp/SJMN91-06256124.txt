Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas told the Senate Judiciary Committee today it is "irrelevant" whether he holds any personal opinion on abortion, spurring new frustration among the committee's Democrats.
Asked several times by Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., about women's right to end their pregnancies, Thomas said, "Whether or not I have a view is irrelevant."
President Bush, asked at a news conference whether Thomas' claim not to have an opinion on abortion is credible, answered, "That's a question for the Senate to decide."
At one point, Biden accused Thomas of using "tortuous logic."
After still another Thomas answer, Biden said, "That's not the question I asked you, judge."
Enough is enough."
"I can walk in the shoes of the people who are affected by what the court does," Thomas said.
Kohl added, "I'm concerned about his candor, his willingness to be forthcoming."
Kohl asked the black federal judge whether he was offended by published comments calling his appointment by President Bush a "quota."
Two pivotal members of the 14-member committee -- Howell Heflin, D-Ala., and Arlen Specter, R-Pa. -- also voiced concern about Thomas' answers.
But the panel's traditional third swing vote, Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said Thomas was doing well.
Thomas' opponents believe Republicans Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, Hatch, Charles Grassley of Iowa, Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Hank Brown of Colorado are solid Thomas backers.
