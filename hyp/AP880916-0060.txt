Hurricane Gilbert's growth from a harmless low pressure zone off Africa to a ferocious killer in the Gulf of Mexico was fueled by a combination of heat, moisture and wind that baffles forecasters.
``It's a matter of getting everything together in the right place in the right time,''
Gil Clark of the National Hurricane Center said Thursday.
``It doesn't happen very often.
Gilbert came to the attention of center forecasters Sept. 3 as a dry low pressure trough moving west out of Africa.
When sustained winds reach 39 mph, the system becomes a named tropical storm.
``The first part of the summer we were biting our nails, wondering why these (other) disturbances didn't develop,'' he said Thursday.
But the scientists do know what fuels a budding storm once development begins.
And they know that development is sparked when winds converge, and that growth is affected by time and place.
That strengthens it,'' he said, adding that storms can begin budding only off the equator because of the Earth's rotation.
This is where Camille formed and exploded,'' referring to the 1969 storm that slammed into the Gulf Coast.
