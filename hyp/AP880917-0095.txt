Hurricane Gilbert weakened to a tropical storm as it blustered northwestward today but it threw tornadoes and sheets of rain at thousands of shuttered evacuees along the Texas-Mexico border.
At least 109 people have been killed and more than 800,000 left homeless since Gilbert ripped through the Caribbean with 175 mph wind earlier this week, then crossed the Yucatan Peninsula and Gulf of Mexico before slamming into northeastern Mexico.
But by this morning, the once massive storm's maximum sustained winds had flagged to 65 mph, nine less than hurricane strength, and forecasters said the eye had all but disappeared.
However, they warned of continued danger from flash flooding inland.
Gilbert was downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 a.m. EDT as it proceeded 50 miles southeast of the city of Monterrey in northern Mexico, said Noel Rishnychok, a meteorologist with the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
At least a dozen tornadoes peppered southern Texas today, following 14 on Friday, killing one woman, striking a hospital complex, military bases and a mobile home park, authorities said.
Gilbert's remnants should bring very heavy rains to Rio Grande valley before heading north up the Mississippi River Valley as a ``huge rain-making machine,'' said Mark Zimmer, meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
By midweek, the storm should be in the lower Ohio River Valley and end up in the Great Lakes as nothing more than foul weather, forecasters said.
``We presume (the Mexican villages) are getting a good pounding from 120 mph winds,'' Zimmer said Friday.
To the south, about 300,000 people were homeless in Yucatan state and 10,000 more were homeless in Campeche, on the west coast of the peninsula, the government news agency Notimex said.
About 125 shelters holding 50,000 people were open in a four-county area of southern Texas around Brownsville, said American Red Cross spokeswoman Barbara Lohman.
