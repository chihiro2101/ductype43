The San Francisco 49ers' 55-10 rout of the Denver Broncos was the lowest-rated Super Bowl in 21 years and the third-lowest ever.
The game on CBS averaged a 39.0 rating and a 63 share, the lowest Super Bowl rating since 1969, when the New York Jets' 16-7 victory over Baltimore got a 36.0 on NBC for the worst rating ever, A.C. Nielsen Co. said today.
The rating is a percentage of the nation's televisions; each point represents 921,000 homes.
Only the 1969 and 1968 Super Bowls had lower ratings; Green Bay's 33-14 victory over Oakland in 1968 got a 36.8.
``Life Goes On'' on NBC got a 6.0 rating and ``Love With a Twist'' on NBC a 7.6.
