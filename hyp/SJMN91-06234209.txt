Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was prepared to head back to Moscow today to reclaim power after the hard-line coup against him collapsed and its leaders reportedly fled.
Outside the Russian parliament, which served as the headquarters for resistance led by Boris Yeltsin, rejoicing crowds cheered and waved flags as the coup ended.
Soldiers, their withdrawing tanks strewed with flowers, waved at television cameras.
Gorbachev was set to board a plane in the Crimea, where he was vacationing at the time of Monday's coup, for the two-hour flight to Moscow, said a deputy to Russian Defense Minister Konstantin Kobets.
Earlier reports that the plane had already taken off were incorrect, officials said.
The Soviet leader, in a statement for radio and television, said he was fully in command of the situation and that the coup leaders would bear "full responsibility" for their actions.
In the United States, President Bush hailed Gorbachev's return to power and said the coup leaders had "underestimated the power of the people, underestimated what a taste of freedom and democracy brings."
"I'm sorry, comrades, but I'm very excited!" said a Soviet TV announcer, grinning broadly after he was allowed for the first time to criticize the coup leaders' actions.
Karyakin said the legislature's executive council demanded Gorbachev's return to power.
They cheered when the announcement of the coup committee's departure came over a loudspeaker.
The plane reportedly carrying the coup leaders was said to be headed to the city of Bishkek, formerly called Frunze, the capital of Kirgizia, 2,100 miles southeast of Moscow, according to Radio Russia, which speaks for Yeltsin.
The report could not be independently confirmed, and the discrepancies could not be clarified.
