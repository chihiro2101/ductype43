While Hurricane Hugo's 135 mph wind roared outside, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. watched the fury it vented on his beloved, 300-year-old city.
Riley, city officials and a few reporters stayed in Charleston's historic City Hall through Thursday night as the area's worst hurricane in three decades pounded the coastal city where the Civil War began.
Late in the day, there was hope Hugo might spare Charleston.
But the storm gathered strength and speed as it spun straight toward this city, which had survived a number of near misses from great storms in recent years.
Later there was a sharp crack as a piece of the tin roof ripped off and water seeped down on the burnished wood tables in the City Council chamber.
