Iran is deliberately underreporting the number of casualties from Thursday's massive earthquake out of fear of a political backlash, leaders of a group seeking to overthrow the country's Islamic leadership say.
``The regime is very much fearful of public outrage,'' said Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran.
As Gobadi spoke Friday, members of the organization denounced Iran's government at a noisy rally held in a park across the street from the White House.
Northern Iran was stuck Thursday by an earthquake measuring between 7.3 and 7.7 on the Richter Scale.
Iran's Islamic republic was established in 1979 after Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was deposed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 Americans hostage.
Dymally, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, praised President Bush's offer of humanitarian aid to Iran but said Bush must make sure the assistance is channeled through non-government groups.
