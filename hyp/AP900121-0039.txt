Troops battled mobs of Moslem separatists in the Kashmir city of Srinagar over the weekend, and at least 21 people were killed and 100 wounded before the fighting subsided Sunday night, police said.
Fifteen demonstrators were shot and killed Sunday, while six were fatally wounded late Saturday night, according to Mohammad Nomani, inspector general of Srinagar police.
Militants defied a curfew and continued trading intermittent shots with government forces on Sunday, officials said.
But gunfire echoed through the deserted streets until evening, one resident said, requesting anonymity.
``They (the troops) are shooting at anything moving,'' he said.
``The situation is tense and dangerous,'' the state's chief secretary, Moosa Raza, said in Jammu, the state's winter capital 95 miles south of Srinagar.
The cars were escorted by heavily armed troops from the paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force, he said.
A 24-hour curfew was imposed Saturday in a bid to quell escalating violence and mass anti-India demonstrations in Srinagar and nearby towns.
Some took up a chant urging ``mujahedeen,'' or Islamic holy warriors, to prepare for the final sacrifice in a showdown with India's Hindu-dominated government.
Abdullah's Moslem-dominated National Conference Party is closely aligned with the Congress Party of Rajiv Gandhi, the arch political foe of Prime Minister V.P. Singh.
