A Hermosa Beach minister who for years has tried in vain to quell rumors tying his church to the McMartin Pre-School scandal announced Sunday that the "extreme stress" of fallout from the case has forced him to seek disability retirement.
The Rev. John D. Eales of St. Cross Episcopal Church -- where McMartin pupils claimed they had been forced to take part in satanic rituals -- told the congregation during his sermon that, "after much prayer and consultation," he realized his health could not withstand the continuing harassment and vandalization the church has borne as a result of the unsubstantiated claims.
The McMartin case, which prompted the longest and most expensive criminal trial in U.S. history, ended Thursday with the acquittal of defendants Ray Buckey and Peggy McMartin Buckey on a total of 52 counts of child molestation at the Manhattan Beach school.
But since 1985, the church has struggled to shake a McMartin pupil's allegation during the preliminary hearing that, six years earlier, he and other students had been forced to witness animal sacrifices and satanic rituals at the altar of St. Cross.
The allegations never died, despite the passage of time and the announcement by Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators that they had found no evidence to support the children's claims.
In a note left in the rectory driveway after the second attack, the vandals, who identified themselves as "the Beach Cities' Conscience," warned that "there is simply no place for Satan worship in this town."
