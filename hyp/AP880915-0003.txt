Hurricane Gilbert, one of the strongest storms ever, slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday and leveled thatched homes, tore off roofs, uprooted trees and cut off the Caribbean resorts of Cancun and Cozumel.
Looters roamed the streets of Cancun, stealing from stores whose windows were blown away.
Despite the intensity of the onslaught and the ensuing heavy flooding, officials reported only two minor injuries.
The storm killed 19 people in Jamaica and five in the Dominican Republic before moving west to Mexico.
Prime Minister Edward Seaga of Jamaica said Wednesday the storm destroyed an estimated 100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes when it throttled the island Monday.
The Jamaican Embassy reported earlier that 500,000 of the nation's 2.3 million people were homeless.
In Cancun, amateur radio operators said an oil tanker from the fleet of the government oil monopoly Pemex, the Lazaro Cardenas, had run aground on the beach in the Cancun hotel zone.
Army officials in Mexico City said about 35,000 people were evacuated from Cancun, but Cancun Mayor Jose Sanchez Zapata said about 11,000 fled.
More than 120,000 people on the northeast Yucatan coast were evacuated, the Yucatan state government said.
The eye of the storm passed over Cozumel and Cancun with howling winds clocked at 160 mph at about 8 a.m. EDT.
The winds bent and toppled utility poles and uprooted slum dwellings.
The storm was about 550 miles southeast of Brownsville, Texas, the center said in a statement.
The Mexican National Weather Service reported winds gusting as high as 218 mph earlier Wednesday with sustained winds of 179 mph.
Such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can cause catastrophic damage.
In Mexico City, the National Civil Defense System said it lost telephone contact with Cancun and Cozumel at about 8 a.m. EDT.
The National Hurricane Center said Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure.
