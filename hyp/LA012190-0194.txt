Geraldo Rivera was interviewing Peggy Ann Buckey on TV.
Abby Mann watched, listened -- and saw the makings of a movie.
Prosecutors had just dropped charges of child molestation against Buckey, one of the original seven defendants in the McMartin Pre-School case.
In that 1986 interview, Peggy Buckey was "quite eloquent" in arguing that charges against her brother, Ray, and mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, should be dropped as well, Mann recalled Friday.
And Thursday's not-guilty verdicts in Ray and Peggy McMartin Buckey's trial gave Mann the happy ending he was hoping for -- happy, at least, from his point of view.
At least two other books are planned, and at least one prominent television movie producer besides Mann says he is developing a McMartin project.
That producer, who requested anonymity, said he is certain other producers are considering projects as well.
The jury's deadlock on 13 counts creates an ambiguity: Is Ray Buckey a villain or a victim?
If I were sitting in my old job, I wouldn't touch this thing with a 10-foot pole."
Producers think network qualms can be overcome, however.
Not long after the first allegations of child molestation six years ago, several producers pitched projects to networks.
Mann, whose writing credits include the Academy Award-winning "Judgment at Nuremberg" in 1961, won an Emmy for "The Marcus-Nelson Murders," a three-hour "Kojak" drama based on a true case in which a black youth was wrongly convicted of the killings of two white women.
That and their earlier alliance with former prosecutor Glenn Stevens sparked charges from parents of alleged child molestation victims of a conspiracy to obstruct justice for monetary gain.
Ray Buckey's lawyer, Danny Davis, and writer Gordon Dillow, former columnist for the defunct Los Angeles Herald Examiner, have a book proposal that is being pitched to a variety of publishers.
