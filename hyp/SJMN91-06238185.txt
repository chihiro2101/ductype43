IT IS the stuff of a Byzantine Cold War novel, enticing enough to grab the attention of even the most benign conspiracy theorist: Did Mikhail Gorbachev orchestrate the coup that almost overthrew him?
The blueprint for imposing a state of emergency was drawn by Gorbachev himself last winter.
He pushed through the legislation that included suspension of political activity and of freedom of the press.
A leading conservative journalist, Alexander Prokhanov, known as the "nightingale of the General Staff," published a transcript of his conversation with the head of the General Staff Academy, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet Navy and Gorbachev's deputy at the Defense Council, Oleg Baklanov.
With remarkable candor, Baklanov called for a military takeover as an appropriate step to avert reforms that would result in a fundamental transformation of the union.
The most volatile fuel for the conspiracy theory came directly from Gorbachev himself, in his Thursday news conference in which he described his three days under house arrest in the Crimea.
It is possible that, unwilling to take a huge risk and openly side with the hard-liners at the start of the coup, Gorbachev had decided to become ill and wait out the initial phase under virtually self-imposed confinement in his summer residence.
One can't help but wonder whether these two visitors came to deliver an ultimatum to Gorbachev and put him under arrest in the event of his non-compliance, or to deliver important documents from fellow junta members at the outset of their joint enterprise.
