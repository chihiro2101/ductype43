Thousands of Americans piled into cars and buses with dogs, cats and duffel bags and left Clark Air Base today after scientists warned that the eruption of a nearby volcano could turn catastrophic.
The decision to evacuate one of the largest overseas U.S. military bases was made early today after searing gases, ash and rock shot out of 4,795-foot Mount Pinatubo on Sunday at speeds of up to 60 mph.
Gases, ash and molten rock continued to pour out of the mountain today, enshrouding it in thick, gray clouds of ash and steam that rose 12,000 feet.
Institute Director Raymundo Punongbayan said Mount Pinatubo was in the "early eruptive stage" and "after that we will have bigger ones."
But he said geological studies showed that in the previous eruption 600 years ago, the main flow cut across what is now the western portion of Clark.
Rains fell across the area Sunday night, and officials warned residents in the lush, green lowlands west of the mountain to move to higher ground to escape mud flows.
Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Ron Rand announced the evacuation in a 5 a.m. broadcast over the U.S. military's Far East Network.
The base is a major terminal for the worldwide network of flights operated by the Military Airlift Command.
The miles-long convoy jammed the two-lane roads leading to Subic, about 50 miles southwest of Clark.
In southern Japan today, Mount Unzen continued to shake and spew hot ash and rocks, and heavy rain was falling on the tons of ash and rock it disgorged over the past week, raising fears of deadly mudslides.
Mount Unzen and Mount Pinatubo belong to the "Ring of Fire" that circles the Pacific where shifting plates of the Earth's crust push against each other, triggering periodic volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.
The last major eruption occurred in 1965, when the Taal volcano, about 50 miles south of Manila, exploded.
