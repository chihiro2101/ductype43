Thousands of John Lennon fans, some too young to remember the Beatles, swayed and sang along with songs including his anthem ``Imagine'' at a hometown tribute.
Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, asked the crowd.
At the close of the concert, she and son Sean, 14, wept and hugged some of the musicians, who included B.B. King, Joe Cocker, Roberta Flack, the Moody Blues, Hall and Oates, Wet Wet Wet and Randy Travis.
Cyndi Lauper, in a white minidress, sang ``Hey Bulldog,'' and Dave Edmunds, backed by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, did the Beatles classic, ``A Day in the Life.''
Ex-Beatles George Harrison, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr did not attend, but McCartney and Starr made taped contributions.
All the musicians assembled on stage for ``Give Peace a Chance,'' as the enthusiastic audience sang along, waved and clapped.
The concert closed with a recording of Lennon singing ``Imagine,'' while giant screens showed a video featuring John and Yoko.
