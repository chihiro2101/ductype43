Port workers in Szczecin and southwestern coal miners today declared sympathy strikes with miners demanding the legalization of Solidarity, opposition activists said.
In support of an estimated 3,000 colleagues striking for a second day at the July Manifesto mine in Jastrzebie, workers at the nearby Morcinek mine refused today to take up their tools and launched their own occupation strike.
Port workers occupied the docks in Szezecin, about 250 miles northwest of Warsaw, and set up a 15-member strike committee, said Jan Kostecki, a leader of the independent union federation.
A local prosecutor immediately declared the strike illegal, Solidarity officials said.
Andrzej Andrzejczak, head of the Morcinek mine strike committee, said: ``We support all of the demands of the July Manifesto mine workers.''
The mine is about 12 miles south of July Manifesto, where strikers were demanding legalization of the outlawed independent labor federation, pay raises and reinstatement of workers fired for trade union activites.
Police ringing July Manifesto, one of Poland's largest coal mines, today turned away area residents who tried to bring food to the strikers.
He said miners erected a large Polish flag atop the administration building and were blocking the complex's main entrance.
The second strike came as Solidarity strike committee members met with management and representatives of the Industry Ministry at the July Manifesto colliery.
Eight years ago, a wave of mine strikes in Silesia ended with the signing at July Manifesto of the last of three agreements that established Solidarity across the nation.
They were joined by workers arriving for the morning shift, Kuron said.
