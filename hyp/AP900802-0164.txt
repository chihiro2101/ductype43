Iraq says it invaded Kuwait at the request of a revolutionary organization there, but diplomats dismiss that rationale as a large-scale charade.
The diplomatic world has remained largely unconviced by the flood of statements issued from Iraq in the name of the Provisional Free Kuwait Government.
Britain's U.N. ambassador, Crispin Tickell, called the Iraqi action ``an invasion from the outside ... a phony coup d'etat from within.''
In a rare display of solidarity, the United States and the Soviet Union called for Iraq to withdraw and imposed sanctions.
But Iraq's deputy permanent U.N. representative, Sabah Talat Kadrat, said the Security Council should not be debating the issue, because the fall of the Kuwaiti Emir, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, was an internal matter.
It has also accused Kuwait of violating its oil production quotas set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, costing Iraq of much-needed revenues because oil is cheaper when supplies are higher.
