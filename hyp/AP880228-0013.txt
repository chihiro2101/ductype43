Debi Thomas' dream of Olympic gold turned into disappointment Saturday as East Germany's Katarina Witt won her second straight Olympic championship and Canadian Elizabeth Manley took home the silver before a crowd of cheering countrymen.

Combined with a fourth in the compulsory figures and a third-place finish in the short program earlier in the week, the performance put Manley in second place.
Sonja Henie of Norway was the only woman to do it before Witt, winning in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
Thomas' bronze was the third figure skating medal here for the United States.
In addition to the three figure skating medals, the U.S. team had three speed-skating medals: one each gold, silver and bronze.
