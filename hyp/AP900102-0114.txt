President Bush has named career diplomat Deane Hinton as ambassador to Panama, the White House announced Tuesday.
Hinton, currently ambassador to Costa Rica, replaces Ambassador Arthur H. Davis, who was recalled by Bush in protest of what the administration considered the stealing of the Panamanian elections last May by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
Bush sent Davis back to Panama City after the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama by U.S. forces and installation of Guillermo Endara as president.
On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called Hinton highly qualified for the post because of his ``wide-ranging experience and expertise in Central America.''
