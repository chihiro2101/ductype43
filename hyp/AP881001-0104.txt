Cynthia Lennon joins the throng denouncing the new, unauthorized biography of her late former husband, John Lennon, as written by a money-hungry author capitalizing on untruths.
``People who write books like this, it is for greed, and as far as I'm concerned, they're gravediggers, no more, no less,'' Mrs. Lennon says on the CBS show ``60 Minutes'' scheduled for broadcast Sunday evening.
The biography by Albert Goldman, ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' depicts the former Beatle as an anorexic bisexual addled by drugs who raged his way from Liverpool to New York.
Goldman, who defends his Lennon book and said it is based on 1,200 interviews, also has written controversial biographies of comedian Lenny Bruce and Elvis Presley.
The couple divorced a few months before Lennon married Yoko Ono in 1969.
Ms. Ono already has trashed the book, calling it ``totally fiction'' in a nationwide broadcast that coincided with the release of the book.
Cynthia and John's son, Julian Lennon, also denounced the book on the radio taping, calling it ``lies, untruths,'' and adding that ``the whole thing is just sickening.''
